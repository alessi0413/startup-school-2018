Well thank you for coming this morning we are

Try something a little bit different this startup school year we are not just how

Having our weekly

Two lectures but we are having some conversations with notable

People and

I couldn't be happier to have

One of the most notable

Startup

People

Here

Get embarrassed when I say anything complimentary so I'll try to avoid it

Program my friend in the

The founder of Y combinator

Back in 2005

And we're just going to talk

And hopefully will be boring

Paul

Yes Jeff

So

You don't got to know each other

Strangely at 8

It was kind of a start of the time Yahoo back in

The late 90s 98

Yeah I know he wrote Yahoo mail

Some of it yeah

Y combinator has the people who wrote Yahoo mail and Gmail that is weird right

Public I'd who who actually has more of a claim

Actually writing

Gmail

And I do have a claim on writing Yahoo mail I wrote I wrote some important parts of Yahoo mail but

Paula's

Kind of by himself to him almost

And we had we

Or a little more intentional Yahoo mail on head

Had a team created something called rocketmail but it is a little weird that both of us ended up

At

Waicu

Years later

But Paul was at

Yahoo

I was at Yahoo because

We create something called rocketmail and we were purchased in 97 to pause company

Was bought in 98 and so

Talk to me

You had this weird idea

For a product for that I took for something you thought people would

Would want in

In the mid-90s

Which has to do with

SAS before science was a thing how did you come up with this idea for for Via what the company that Yahoo bought

Okay so what we made was something that is now called a web app

Ibible

At the time it was the first one

And that's why the company was called via web

Via the web

And

The way I remember it very vividly

We thought back then everybody thought that writing software was identical

With writing software that ran on

Client and we're still for those of you who remember the mid-90s

The client

Windows

Right

And like

We knew how to write software for Unix

We like the eunuch

We did not know how to write software for Windows but we knew enough to know that we did not want to learn

And so

We were really really highly motivated

To figure out

How to write software without having to write software to run on Windows

And so we thought you were so

Maybe we know the way I first thought of it actually

Was that you would have this you would have it was an online store Builder

Right

And I thought

That you could

You could send it updates by email

That was

I thought you could send it updates by email

Right

And it would change her website

And then I remember thinking we'll if you toaster is 4

Shopping

Carts or whatever

If you can use SMTP

Why not http

Top hit your website

Well you could come the software can run on the server

And you can control it by clicking on links in the browser would that even work

Right but I remember I was like sleeping on a mattress on the floor

In Robert spare bedroom I remember I sat up in bed when I thought of this like I like the letter L

Right it was actually like one of those scenes in the movie I'm like oh my God we could avoid having to write

Software on Windows at all

We never at that point we were never thinking about the benefits of web apps which are great

As it turned out

We were just thinking we could like actually do this without ever having to learn Windows it didn't matter that

Like you could deploy then without having no no

The gates never have to learn Windows because

Like the Netscape people had already gone through the pain

Love making Netscape work on

Windows

That was like a whole on to Windows

You know

Could get through the whole and click on links in the browser

Controller

And so we immediately we weren't even sure this week

It was so weird

But we immediately sat down and tried to write

Really really

Website builder

The work bikes

It was terrible but

It did actually work

Make a website

Like b*******

Actually works

Jets weird that like

An Innovative idea like that just sort of

Comes out of no amnesty doesn't seem Innovative now because

All websites work that way but

The first one

Like that's that's working 0-2-1 how do you

Siri, happened right very common for ideas in

They seem obvious and you a met you sort of historians you weren't there

Straighten out all the Kinks in the development and it just seems like oh they had this

You know it's like this idea I always hate it when people represent start-up ideas

Light bulbs

You know because as well as being the most cliched metaphor imaginable it's also false

You don't just like have this idea and then realize it

Right now it's more like you have this sort of inkling that something you could do something that somebody else hasn't done before

It's probably a bad idea but you're too lazy to learn windows and so you want to do it that way right

And so or like

Who would like suck starting Facebook

You know just like

Let's see what happens

It's right

William possible that this would ever be a starter

Which is

Good for you all hopefully some of your ideas seem really implausible

Right

I love it when ideas seem implausible in the right way over the years I mean I already had

Just from being a hacker

Assertive

A good news for this sort of thing but it has become refined

Over all these years of dealing

I would start up some when

When people have I was talking to some people yesterday and they were talking about

Two possible things they could do and one of them seemed so

It seems like naughty

Not like it was it was it was

Maltreating NE

It was just started taking advantage of something

It seems like it shouldn't even be possible

Bright like like making this software run on the server and just like

Never making software that seem to the user to run on their computer but actually was just talking to them through the browser

I kind of naughtiness

I said like pick that one because it seems it seems so

Outrageous it seems so hilarious

It seems like

Is all these ways we have talking about what's a good idea

And when you try to match up ideas with them it's always kind of a complicated but you know it's like is this idea naughty

Or is it

Is it is it

Is it like not quite

Intuitive or not so obvious and it's really always hard to

To take any particular idea and say is that the one with potential well you can't tell in fact that's another

It's not just that

The outcomes of startups are hard to

I predict I think to some degree there actually indeterminate

There's a huge amount of luck involved

You know

And so

I think even if even if y combinator were

Is good at picking start up so you could cuz you could possibly get I mean in fact you have like

150 startups per batch in which maybe 5 will become Giant

Or something like that

That would be good yeah well depends on your definition of giant right it's a power line distribution

I like

If for some definitions of giant one of that one every time

Definitely happy

So

Was I saying

Talking about

Like determinacy of ideas even if you were able to pick

Perfectly that doesn't mean you

You could get the batch

You probably have to

Even if you were

So you just it's just it's hard it's hard it's hard to know

There's this there's a strange mix of extraordinary hard work

An idea that

Actually

Has something to it but it's not obvious

It's hard for Founders to know

If you don't know yourself

You don't know yourself

I mean I mean you don't know, yourself not that you don't know yourself so that it's also true

So and that's why it's good to be a hacker because if you're some business person

You know and you think

I am going to work on business opportunities

Well I don't know if this is a business opportunity so I'm not going to work on it

Where is someone who's a hacker

When is it

Or because they don't like Windows

Yeah laziness to

Lisa this is actually in some cases really helpful kinds of lazy

Scared about this meme escaping into

The wild

Can't you just see can't you just see it it's true like I said laziness is good he said from the sofa

It another time

Yeah you better if people thought laziness wasn't good because the glazing that's the kind of people do that's good they do what they would do

Anyway even if they saw it's weird

Yeah it is about using laziness not in the normal sense

Delete it that's right because if you're late there's no such thing as a lazy founder that

That doesn't make

There's

But but there a certain sort of

It's a reticence to do something for some reason it's not really

Lapse

It makes you know if you have a natural hatred for gratuitous slap schlep

Like

Then what that for that produces Alig

So 1995

I was

Like trying every single idea I could possibly try to start some internet business

And I was doing it all by myself

Which was awful

And

And what I didn't know how to do was to find

People that do it with and I kind of ran into a bunch of people and I had no clue whether they would be good people too

Start

Companies with an I was thinking about your experience you said you were like sleeping on Roberts while you started you started via well with two

Fascinating People

Robert Maxwell Trevor Blackwell

Who later Robert Mara

Morrison Trevor Blackwell

And it was a weird

Mix up names anyway

How did you pick them as co-founder how did that happen in and when did you decide they would be good cold

Were they good co-founders

All right yeah right

They're extremely worked they were extremely truculent code programming

But I remember Robert was like not into the whole startup thing

The entire way

Like whenever he was on the board

And whenever we got it whenever you get an acquisition offer the board has

Consider it right

Incel

You'll get these

Crap low-ball acquisition

Will give you like 2 million dollars in our stock

Right yes no no Robert would say

Like we would vote on it and Robert would always say well you know I have to be honest here like this would at least mean we could stop working on this

Thing and so

Yes I would take this deal

I made a deal with Robert that if he ever made a million dollars out of

Via web he would get an earring

Property

The kind of guy

He would enjoy having an earring

Let me tell you

And so

As soon as the deal clip me and Trevor

Frog marched him

To the place in Harvard

Square where

Never heard this

We got him an earring there's photograph on the internet

With an earring

He didn't keep it when his food not for long we should have specified

I never thought

I never thought this message I thought you actually get the million dollars I really actually did but I thought he would

Where true bit longer

She fell on the

Why did you

Choose

Why did I cheat Island Tram Islanders

I chose Robert because he was my co-conspirator in everything

And I don't mean I was always that I was always the lead and he was just

The co-conspirator we did things I would be

Like the internet worm Robert Morris is

Preventing it's all on his own yeah

Invented Buffalo

And I remember when you told me about it

Wow what a cool idea should totally do that he was the first famous hacker who really got in trouble

Yeah really enjoy

He was the way it's true he was the first person

Prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986

So if you're looking for a co-founder look at people who been prosecuted cuz it works yeah he is actually a convicted felon

Okay anything we don't necessarily want to escape out there that convicted felons or what you want to look for is coal found

That

Yeah it was funny because the FBI

Dateline Forest

Kind of does things by the book

Right like

Imagination

Is a big thing in in like Sherlock Holmes stories but not an actual everyday law enforcement

And so they have these

The FBI agent told me

Like they have these motive they look for sex

Drugs

Money Revenge right

And so like

Robert did it out of curiosity and that's just thinking if it's just not on the list

They really had a hard time figuring out what the hell

What's going on I think even within the government there were lots

So back to

Robert and Trevor who

Also why do I pick Robert Trevor Roberts

Robert

Robert I picked cuz I would I would you ever see

We had all this game

And it so you knew you could work with

I mean is really good he was a really good program

He could program as fast as he could type of course this isn't see which is a lot of very verbose

Language

But but you can program as fast as you

Get type you is amazing you would like if he didn't like what the operating system would do it you would edit the source

And recompile it and then it would do what he wanted

So I can decide he was exceptional like when he showed up at Harvard

Undergrads were only allowed to have

Accounts on like the official undergrad

Computing system off in the science center and they're always real computers in the

Siesta Park

Ican lab

And so they wouldn't give him an account there and so he just walked up to machine

You know Switched at the single user with him is the Superuser gave himself an account and then

Just curious

Yeah

Well you also wanted accounts on the right machines

He got kicked

This whole thing will be about Robert

You got kicked out of Harvard is an undergrad for reconnecting Harvard to The Intern

Harvard Harvard

That's so funny to like

Like get in trouble for

Disconnecting a school from the internet connection

We're we're we're we're still trying to figure out why the heck you

Oh I should tell you that

That how he

Reconnect to tell us about the disconnecting

So we have all day

We don't you have no idea how long do you have

We have we have enough

We have the same watch

More or less

Robert

Heat heat heat

And

By the time Robert arrived

Is an undergrad

The connection it died from Ithaca

Like no one noticed that's how unimportant the internet was back

Or rather are panda

Barely an internet

Yes yes Robert

I need like 10 20 work for any of this

Classes in you got such bad grades yet

Got kicked out for a year

So we actually use that later as a recruiting tool

Because we knew that because there might be other people who got killed

Kicked out for spending all their time on some projects

And so we actually went around Harvard

I'm posted up this poster saying did you get kicked out

Working on some project to your own we'd like to hire you

I think there's probably a really good programmer that way

Tons of money off of options acquired during the year

Right and you like enjoyed life out of school so much I don't think he went back until he was 25

So

Alright so why the hell why Trevor

White Trevor 12 Robert was the guy you did everything with and he was great

Okay so after we've been doing that when you pick Robert did you know he was

Going to be a pain in the ass and so many ways as you like or was that a surprise to you I knew he was a pain in the ass

I didn't know the company was going to be so hard and it would bring out so much

So you didn't realize how hard starts were way we got Trevor with Varian

Yeah

So a month and we've been working on this company

And Robert Rebelle

He says

We've been working on this company for a whole month and it's still not done

What the f*** you gotten me into

And I thought maybe we need more programmers so I said alright Robert

Who's the smartest person you know

In grad school he said Trevor

Bright Nights at Trevor

Break

Coverage one of those people who seems like he's a lot smarter than you seem

So but if Trevor is actually super smart and so we went and recruited Trevor

He said okay

That's that's a really good Trevor Canadian Trevor had to mow

Which is what he does when he does something that breaks everything which is very common very calm

And so

We got Trevor I recruited Trevor

To work on this

He does nothing

Two weeks at least as far as I can tell

Disappears

And then 2 weeks later he says come into my office

He's Rewritten all our God damn software and small talk

Can you text that typical yes so I said alright Trevor

We're not using that but do this instead

Right and so Trevor

Super productive

Hacking monster

You didn't know that in advance you just

Trusted Robert

When Robert told you he was really smart Robert said he was the smartest he's definitely the smartest

Deep lesson in that and how you how you

Weather weatherton pleaser co-founders

It's you find someone you trust

And then find someone they Trust

Yeah although there's an interesting point

That works better for some qualities

Like intelligence

Intelligent people can judge other intelligent people

The trustworthy people cannot trust judge other trustworthy people in fact trustworthy people are often the full Bayan

Trustworthy people

So I take Courthouse

Play car architect

Super trustworthy

She's always full

Sneaky schemers

You know you take advantage

So I guess that means you take recommendations from people but then you have to add your own

No no no

And I disagree I think I must

Yeah but you need to hear some qualities better than others but you want them to be trustworthy when they join you as a cool fan

So you have to add that judgement of trustworthiness yes this whole thing

You have to have someone you can judge whether people are trustworthy

Which

I am not even good at I am not good at the person who does that for a y combinator is Jessica

The social radar

The secret power be

So you did hire people

Via web to

What did you learn about hiring in your

First startup

So you learned it

They they if they were getting lousy grades

If you're working on a project that seems good

Which is

Which is kind of counterintuitive

A lot of things we seem to do it while I see end up being counterintuitive

Startups in general are very very counter

Intuitive

And so

That's actually YZ exist

It was obvious what

What to do when starting a startup

We wouldn't why she couldn't really

Add much by teaching people how to do it right

And so

I often say

I often in fact practically everyday if I do officer

I'm reminded of this that like what y combinator does is tell Founders things that they ignore

Right so

We tell people

Don't hire too fast

And then they go off and I are too fast and then they come back later and say hello I wish we listened

Like

All the things we tell people we tell people to counterintuitive

Not the obvious

Stuff and then what counterintuitive means is

It sounds wrong

And so they go with their gut

And do the wrong thing instead and then

Hopefully catch the mistake in time

Why is it that startups are so counterintuitive

You know that would be if that would be very much writing

An essay about

I don't know

I don't know

I don't know

It's the ice I could come up with some theories but I have a feeling the answer is so interesting Lee complicated

Howdy unlikely to come in or just talking about one of the things that

Did that you did write an essay about

Which is somewhat counterintuitive when you start a startup and you like okay now I'm going to grow and then you write a whole bunch of stuff

Software that helps you grow and

And you are a whole essays that don't do that

Do things that don't scale

In the beginning yeah

Do things to downscale

Because

Growth is when you can start by saying what it means to do things that don't scale cuz I don't know if you guys have read the message

Ready I'm sure you've already but this is that this is actually very important cuz most of you all have

Early startup

And when you do an early start up

It's become our Mantra YC and I've seen it again and again you should not try to do too much in the beginning you should do thing

Things that don't scalp

What doing things that don't scale mean specifically

Is doing things in a sort of handmade artisanal painstaking way

That you feel

Like yeah it would be great

If you could do things that way forever but you know you're in the back of your mind you think yourself well there's no way we can keep doing this

Become giant right

What do you think means

Do those things early on anyway

Because

You know if you don't do them you'll never be big any until you got nothing to lose and also you learn a lot from it

You learn a lot and so

I discovered a lot of things that we teach

Startups y combinator or uteach startups a y combinator I'm retired and if you know that

But a lot of things you guys teach startups is

Are things that I

Hit myself

And didn't realize that they were actually common startup lessons

So one of them is

Doing things very manually for your early custom

Like it's so important to get early customers

But if you have to do a ton of manual stuff

That's okay you'll learn a lot from it

Did you guys do manual stuff we thought

Oh we're doing it wrong this is so lame and in fact it was exactly the right thing we made an online store Builder

You can build a store on the internet to sell stuff

And

We would go to would be

Would be

Customers and say

Would you like to use our easy online store Builder and they would say no

And we would say but you want an online store right

And they would say yeah and they would say well what if we use we would say what if we used our software for

Make an online store and then you can have it

Would that be goodnight say alright

And sweet like

Can't get anyone to use our software but at least they're willing to let us use it for them

And it seemed it seems so lame

I learned so much s*** about like direct marketing as it turns out it's called who were members of the dma

The direct marketing Association

That's what

You know in every business card carrying member of the dma were we were in every business they have a name

And for the business that's not the name Outsiders call it

Like fast food no no no they don't call it that

They called fast-casual within the industry

Indian in the catalog business

They used to call the direct marketing

Right now I'm so that's what the

Dma meant back in the day

The catalog does

We signed up for every catalog

Catalogs to get in the mail

We would just like right away to write and ask for more we had this

Bookshelf

Full of every catalog

Yeah it seems like almost like if you were building a new search engine what you want to do is have a

Have your box out there and then

Just take all the

Churches manually in line

Get results and throw him out there and see what see what happens and what we did for mail that was manual in the beginning we we had

Emmanuel ad server like we didn't really have ADD serving Technologies we just throw at like

I wrote it so it was really good

And

And we would just throw them in there

There's a deep lesson therefore

For four people don't like what happens if you stink you know the solution and you

Build lots of stuff for it you're going to be wrong

Could you just don't know it having to use our software myself made it

Much better

Cuz I would be using our software to make someone's website

Right and I was also the guy who wrote the site Builder

It's already using and think to myself

Inconvenience

Going in the middle of building their site I would change the software

I mean

Ship as in

Like MV

Like that's the great thing about server base software ship is the Unix MV command

So well no CP I would want to keep a copy of a source

But I would like

Change the software in the middle of using it and then go back to working on their website and boy did that make that that made the software much better

Better that I had to use it

Yeah

So

So

Picking co-founders

You want to pick the best people who you can somehow believer

Trustworthy

Sprite help

Lot of people think a lot of people taking the class or so Founders now

Yeah why is it that

That so founders

The penis hole founder soda

Wow

There's so many different reasons

It's like

I think the hardest part is moral

There's no one there's like if you have multiple people they keep one another going when things are going badly

And there's no one to cheer you up

That's what's hard for me I remember 95 and love you like I know this internet thing is going to be real but

Oh so you are so founder yeah

Yeah that's why his hair is grayer than mine

DM

Yeah I like being a soul Hunters hard

Like it's hard because there's a million reasons

Why what you doing isn't going to work and mostly your right

So it's easier to commit yourself

Say this I always remember you should say look your two choices as a founder

Remember what you would say after that

Well there's so many different cases version to this until you could either quit or get rich

Yeah diary

Like the company is a lot of start-up mostly

The company either dies were to get rich

You know you have a nice little business where you're the boss and you have 20 or 50 employees or could mean your

Airbnb right

Outcomes

Not good for your investors necessarily but for you that really good

And and doing things

You know and internalizing what that really means I was thinking about you know one of the

It's a sort of a things that don't scale we talked about it why see all the time we say you supposed to

For Success you talk to users

Android code

You talked and

If you think about it

Talking to users especially is sort of the founder doesn't really scale very well

But that's what it forces you to do if you have to do everything doesn't scale forces you

To learn

Right in the beginning

You only have 10 customers

You want to grow

20% you wanna go 10% next week I only got to get one more customer

You can go out and do that very manually

Right and then next week you have 11 customers you have to get 1.1 customers right

Basically one right you just keep going out there and doing things manually and as long as your growth rate is good

It doesn't matter how small the number is because

Agro a constant growth rate means exponential growth and that means

The base number will soon take care of itself

Thinking about

What makes companies good

How do you spell

I was thinking about maybe how we could talk a little bit about

Some of those

Those aspects of

How people can kind of figure out

How they're doing here we have thousands of companies out in startups coolant

Trying to figure out

What to do next and what are they doing the right thing and whether they're failing and whether they're

On the right path

What makes companies fail most of the time is poor execution by the founders

We often talk to startups

Who are worried about competitors

And one good one advantage if why is he having fun did so many companies have a really large dataset in like

How many companies have been killed by competitors one

More than one atom

1900

Right now

So

Itel startups

Basically you have

The same protection against competitors

It's the light aircraft have against crashing into other light aircraft when flying through clouds

You know what the protection is

Space is large

Little Cessnas don't have any radar in them

You can't see in clouds

It's a it's this falls under the rubric of counterintuitive

Advice cuz one of the things that happens all the time

Is people come up and say oh my God

There's another new company what should I you know that's exactly my space what should I do right and it sort of

Like if you're running the hundred meter

Right and suddenly there appears another Lane with another runner in it

What should you do

Run as fast as you can just like you presumably were

If they're better than you they'll win

And if not then

Then you'll win

And that's a good reminder could everyone please silence your phones

If you haven't already

Yeah what else like

What are the what are the things we do a lot is try to judge right

Companies that find who's going to succeed and

And

And you guys are doing the same thing yourself hopefully

What what

What is it

It makes startup succeed that makes startup succeed

Well you have to start with

A good sounding team ideally not just one person

I couldn't I ended up

By end

Having to join other people

I actually think that was not right

I couldn't do it it

I'm not built that way I think most people aren't built that way that's cuz my questions about Robert and Trevor

You know it's just

So difficult

I would not

Try and start a startup just with

Just myself

I think I could do it

Yeah it's long enough anyway

So you need a good solid founding team you know one another well and who can work together just like stop

Pause there like

Knowing one another well why does that even matter

Because

What happens in a startup

Will shake your relationship

If there's any sort of

Flakiness or uncertainty your disloyalty or whatever like lingering in there it will emerge under the

The stresses of a startup

Yeah

It's like a marriage only harder

You spend more time with that

Another difference

There's

There's

Potentially

Okay so you get a good founding team

You get someone who you can

Stan stress with

So there's two categories of stuff

There's two categories of answer we could give here like there's the answer you give to investors

About how to pick startups

And there's the end then there's only a subset of you if that is useful to founder

It's right so like if

Like if you need to tell him that's what you want to pick smart

Write the counters are as smart as they are at a party

We can meet Ellen get smarter right and actually it turns out it's not that important

Be smart

It's much much more important

Determined

If you if you imagine

If you imagine this hypothetical person who's like a hundred

100 out of a hundred for smart and 100 out of a hundred for determination

Right and then you start taking away determination

You know it doesn't take very long before you have this Earth in effect

Actually

Brilliant person

Where is if you take someone who's like super super determined

And you start taking away smartness bit by bit

I mean

Eventually you get to some guy who owns a lot of Taxi medallions but he still rich

Right

Or like a trash-hauling business thing like that but like

You can take away a lot of smart

Yeah I have to take a lot of smart and an ad

And take away a bunch of Ethics at the same time and then you get that guy right you can be president

Yes I've been thinking about what

Thought that would

Trump would actually Teach an important lesson for startups all about determination

We we we think about those are too like the intelligent access on the determination access

And obviously if you were really intelligent really determined that's awesome there's

By the way only one person has to be super determine right right so like

You know you can have one person who really wants to start the one the company in one person you and Robert

After a month is like what we're still working on that depends on this Titebond where you can drag that person along with you other

So eyes look away but actually another access which is

You have to have the ability somewhere on your team

2

To

PepperJax to think it would because your idea is going to suck

And then it'll suck less and less until you have to have the ability to think what where should we like to navigate like you have to have

Some sort of creativity

That allows you to

2

To like make the right choices as no actually you might not have to be that creative

If you care enough about user

You can just follow what what what will make users how many in the way

Riley a scientist follows the

The truth and eventually

Without much thinking on your part

The need to grow will give you this product idea that's actually the product that that's the result of

Revolution

So maybe you're either sort of

Steve Jobs and Ken into it what customers need or you just have to have the skill of actually talking to

Customers and understanding what they're saying which isn't always obvious you know Steve Jobs

Was he satisfied users to accept he was the user it's like

I don't want to have any

Phone jack anymore so

No more phone jacks for anybody

Right now maybe he was just lucky that he his his his desires were generic enough that it was close enough

You was living in the future like you didn't really like the internet except for reading the New York Times we never really got that right

Interesting

You work 10 you work you work tablet one point after you that bought did what was it like what was diva

Can you tell

From where you were an apple with Steve was like

Yeah I got to talk to him a few times

Helium

He's different

Tell us tell us how

Are there useful lessons you can learn from them or if you want to

I wouldn't presume that I only met with him a handful of times and I wouldn't presume to know too much about them

Direct evidence stories and stuff

Yeah like you ever see Founders at YC

You think yourself who is like Steve Jobs

Yeah I don't think we

I don't think we'd fun to Steve Jobs at YC that's not good yeah and the reason is is

Especially when Steve Jobs was turned out he was an a****** I think actually you would

Because Steve Jobs make you feel

Maybe right maybe we try like we try to avoid people who seem like they're assholes and I think he

Like An Enderman

Like we like

You know you want a whole essay on being nice

The Ronco principle right

There's a couple couple yeah that'd be nice yeah right and I don't think

He would

Have passed the test especially when he was younger

Which is worried about that because it's true that

It's usually good to be

Nice and friendly end

Benevolent

He was

Maybe if I see you caught them early

We could have helped

Maybe maybe maybe that was maybe that's part of what made him successful in the beginning I don't know

I don't know I don't know it works for Donald Trump

Donald example right yeah

In business determination matters more

Business is not identical with startups

I want to leave these these guys sometime to ask question

I want like

What are they going to get wrong

What what mistakes were these people make

Then maybe maybe hearing them might

Help it probably won't because

You won't listen

But

What you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention

Do users

You will have you will make up some idea in your own head

That you will

Call your vision

And then you will spend a lot of time thinking about your vision

In a cafe

By yourself

And right

Built an elaborate thing

Without going and talking to users because that's doing sales which is a pain in the ass and they might say no

And you'd be way better off finding someone

Anyone who has a problem

That they will pay you to fix

And fixing it and then seeing if you can find more people like that

Best cases if you yourself have the problem

Right but like

You will not ship fast

Cuz you don't want to face the

You are embarrassed ship something

I'm finished and you don't want to face the

The likely feedback

Humiliating when they tell you how shitty what you built

Actually it is

Right

That's the only way you get it better

Yeah

So you will shrink from contact with the real world

Contact with your ear users

That's the mistake you will make

Yeah there's a program ISM in there which is all around launching

Fast launching before you're ready that I sometimes tell people the story of

It's Reid Hoffman

Actually

I think he said if you're not

Embarrassed with what you like

I remember when I was

I was

20 Y combinator and at the same time this is not in this way good idea of launching imagine K12

This that's attack version of YC

And

And I came in to talk to Paul

And he's like so how's it going with imagine K12

She helped out a lot and I said I was going well probably called something else

He actually give us the name of Magic 8 12 and so it was called the magic words like when you get a lunch and I was like what

Oh

We're going out rpr plan

We're finishing the software so it looks was like

You know where we're going to have a summer batch and this was probably in

February or something

Nice until we have like it'll probably in like 6 weeks and want to just launched

When you just lunch now

And I was like

Damn

He just did it to me

Then we did we want we want sleep

What's in a week

We launched

And so that is a mistake you'll make your way too long you'll you'll

You'll be embarrassed you'll

We launched ycee probably

In less than a week of having the idea

Of course launching it was merely saying was merely posting a website

And

And we didn't have we didn't have any software in the beginning

People we just

Had this ASCII

Form that people would fill out and reply to us by email

The first couple batches

The applications were by email

You would print them out

And pass them around

Amongst the partners

And like we would all right grades on the top

Like we are grading papers

And then we would sort this heap of papers and that was the application process

Try to do that with

Thousands of applications now would be harder so we have lots of software that does that cuz eventually you scale

Eventually you

You build software when you learn what software you out of

Building

It'd be fun to spend a lot of time more time talking about how why she got

Got started but

But I think

Rather than that let's some

We can probably go to around 12 and and

Videos that get to longer

No one wants to watch anyway so so we're going for about 40 minutes or so so let's open up to

Any questions

Your eyes might have

Yeah

You want to

Then you might have

Are you saying that if you get if you recruit your co-founder your friends is co-founders you might lose them as friends

I mean I don't think that's a big danger

I don't think you have the question was

Should I have my friends be couponers and then maybe risk losing them as friends or should I just take someone off the street where I

I don't have the risk of losing them as friends but I

They might break my company

That was a question I get that right

I already answered it dude come on we got the question to just because

How do you spell with

Different

Wondering how do you feel different

Founders and also

If you had to fire a co-founder

How would you go about how do you deal with different commitment levels

ABCO Founders and if you do have to fire a co-founder what should you do

Okay so the way you deal with different commitment levels as you ask yourself

Would I rather have

30% of this person

Or a hundred percent of some other person

And in my case I would rather have like

10% of Robert Morris is brain than a hundred percent of almost anybody else

So is an easy decision

How do you fire co-founders

In y combinator the answer is

Yeah you ask Carolyn Levy

Y combinator has there's so much experience dealing with crap like firing co-founders

And like you just go and talk to them they say here you do this in this in this

Right

And how do you play online 2 so you could Google it

Really his wife's he published had a fire truck sound

We have published we've actually if you look at some of the talk Carolyn is given and Chrissy I'm pretty sure they've covered

That particular issue will you deal with it by the way is making sure that

Someone

Has a little bit more stock bratty like it's usually better to have someone

Dumb

Equal shares not not but not completely cool and it's one person has

51% the other person is 49% than they can

Usually scheduled Deadlock

Yes

So when you talk about non is launching to like private bait out a couple of people good enough or do you have to just watch it

So what does launch really mean

Image of actual okay so the question is is launching in a private beta to a few people get enough rediff

How to watch the General Public

I will take

Launching in just a private paid it to a couple people cuz that's closer to the that's closer to full launch than

Just sitting thinking of your idea in a cafe

Next

Yes

The current

Fundraising project

Project

Maybe it was overrated

Icos

Yeah what do you think about ico's Paul

I have I have not know nothing about this world

I've heard there's a huge amount of crypto money floating around

So like

If there's money floating around it's often a good idea for startups to try and get it

Beyond that I don't know but I will say like one of the things we've seen a lot of Y combinator is is not always right

Great race too much money

And even if you don't it is likely you'll see my definition of too it's always wrong

Yeah

Wait a lot of money and the thing about there's a couple reasons for that one you dilute more than you

You definitely need to but the other reason is that

Money just

Sitting there has sort of a gravitational

The next Knicks makes you spend

And it makes you do stupid things so it's like this companies that raise a billion dollars and ico's and

I don't know if I'll ever have a real company

Where you get like if you got a bunch of LPS and raise a billion dollars and then you just

Hire so many more people than you actually need right

That's what I said that's the difference when I see how I get it but just having a billion dollars when

You only barely have an idea is not necessarily like

You know

Magic leap raise 2.3 billion dollars and they seem to have almost nothing by the way that is the trick for getting your

Question answered I learned that a long time ago you raise your hand as you're finished as people are finishing the proceeding

Question

And I see that guy's hand over there he knows the trick go ahead what is it

What are your best tips for a great

My best tips for a great user interview

Well you want to figure out

Not just what they think is wrong but what's actually wrong

Like what missing in their life

Right so

Just start talking to them like

Like say what would you like to do

Would you like to be able to do that you can't

And they might just you know they might be able till 10 to give you an answer that's like a subset

Right

Like

You know if you heard asking someone about email

They like to say

I like you know it's really important to me to be able to mark emails as unread

Right what does it mean unread

That whole unread thing as assigned

The whole inbox is being misused is what's really going on if it's a to-do list

You know and that's why you have to mark items as unread they stay on your to-do list

And so

You could see start asking them with what's wrong

And then you try and figure out what they really mean but they're really getting at which they themselves might not know

You know and then you start asking them

So what if you could do such-and-such what if you could do such and such right to start by asking them questions about their life

And then got get hypothetical on them

Okay we should ask

On this site

You've taken over so you just keep calling him your doing great

You pick your car

Right there in the way corner

Kind of off one of the questions asked somebody else to ask earlier so we can talk about launching early

Right how do you justify the Financial Risk in turbulence

How do you justify the financial risk of launching a shity product

Okay

So the risk of launching early is not as great as the risk of

Watching late

Not like that only risk on one side right

There's a risk of launching late to

So you got to have a rule of thumb about when to lunch

And my rule of thumb

The way I like

I have this phrase for it didn't become a sticky is minimum viable product cuz it describes what the minimum viable

What product has

But

It's Quantum of utility

Right

Launch as soon as you have a Quantum of utility

Which means

As soon as

You're there's one person in the world

Who is glad that you launched because now they can do something that they couldn't do

When there's when you if you don't if you have something that if you launched it

No one

Would be happy

Then you're not ready to lunch

Right as soon as there's at least somebody out there who would say oh

Here's this thing I can use cuz I can do action before that I couldn't do it

Then you should watch

Soon as you have a Quantum of utility

It sounds like to someone

Utility function like if it makes too many people happy in like one person happy and like

100 really unhappy maybe it's not ready

But if you it'll public aid always says if you have 10 people who really love your product

That's a good place to be yeah all you need is a few

That's why

If there's 10 people who are super excited

Totally totally launch

Unlike a nobody else cares

That is perfectly fine

Great

Okay yeah can you talk about the difference between

Most of the time

Well the dangerous building okay the question is how do you decide between building what people need

Building what people want right well the problem is

What you really want to be doing is build something people will choose to use or buy more

Becoming your user or something like that

And so here's a counterexample to the whole need vs. want

What people need is healthy food

What people buy is unhealthy food

So if you're a business

Which one do you want to do

Hate

I mean yeah ideally you want to make

Healthy food that also tastes good

Right but really

You can't you can't push this too far

You can't push this too far

I mean I myself would not start some company making junk food or something

Things like that but if you are making

Seafood

Don't like or something where need and want are very different be real careful about picking need you know

Or you'll go out and then you know your goal will be to cleanse the world of sin or something like that

It's easy to lose yourself as a Founder to think you're like you're the other danger is

What they need is what you think that

What you're talking about is what you think they need

Cleanse the world of your definition of sin

Right

Yes

Yeah my name is

My question is when I'm working my project

Sometimes

Different problem

Is that normal is a founder

Is it normal as a Founder to be to see multiple different solutions

Yeah sure absolutely

You just have to pick one

Take the one that you think could get

Could get usage quickest

And what's the

What's the founder DNA

Foundered

Give me what makes a what makes someone a founder

The choose to be one

Explanation

What makes someone a good founder a combination of positive and negative things I think

Positive things are things like

Determination and you know willingness to try new things

But then there may also be negative thing

Like

If if you are

I think if you have worked for a large company for 20 years

You might not be a Founder unless you were forced to for Visa reasons

Because if you were the kind of person that would that would make a good founder you wouldn't be able to stand working

For a large company

For 20 years

Right

And so actually we've noticed certain companies

Where the alumni of these companies tend to make bad Founders and it's because

No one who would make a good sound or could have

Stood working

Curtain for these companies for very long

Okay maybe we should pick one on this site

Okay

Depression is pricing

Especially important

What do you what do you price during lunch well

You can probably guess

If you know your business you know roughly what you should charge

She's probably just go with whatever you guess if you want to be more scientific about it you could try

Talking to

Talking to some potential users most of the time you have some sort of tame users

Who are actual users that are also friends of yours or something like that or family

And you can ask them tell me honestly like what would you actually pay for

Right

You can always change your price

Later though

If you want to lower your prices no one's going to complain

And if you want to Grant if you want to raise your prices you just grandfather your existing users

Which if you have exponential growth will always be a tiny subset of your total users and then I won't complain about that either

So don't sweat about it too much really I think about that is it just seems like in the beginning

What you need more than anything is customers

And you want them to pay so you will need to pick up price that get you customers

So you'll learn could you learn so much from those customers and definitely don't understand right don't lose

Customer price

Yeah cuz in the beginning you just want Chris

Did the customer teach you the first customers don't just

Give you money

They teach you

Alright two more questions

You too you picked you

I'm okay right up front here

Angel Investing so my name is Karen and I'm with tattoos and which is a chat manager

So

3 tips for

The only way in and finding Angel Investors if you don't have here the rich uncle is excetera

Fundraising at all

We both do this whole thing again

That's good

Fun fundraising is it is it

As it is in Oculus the thing to occupy your thoughts as a founder

Is overrated

Better not to be spending all your time thinking about fundraising

We come to it much later in the class so we don't need to

The question was how to find Angel Investors

Well that's the that's the thing I'm particularly ill-suited to answering that question

Because why commentator is like this machine for funneling

Angel Investors into all the startups that it except still like

How do you find Angel Investors

It's like asking a pilot how to wean a walk along

Track on the ground

I know the least about that

Here's the thing

Angel Investors are looking for you

So get out there

Go to

I don't know well there's there's lots of startup events that angels are like

Good angels

But angels are out there looking in the

Look the best way

To actually meet angels

Is the get one to invest in you and then to introduce you to people hanging out

I know the

Find find people who work at startup

And ask them to introduce you to their investors

That's the way to do it

That's a good answer okay

Last question Paul you get to you get to choose maybe from this site there

Is YZ thinking of going after high school students

Fun

Well I don't know because I don't think on behalf of ycee anymore but you better not be because that would be an evil thing to do

There are twice the high school students could there plenty of high school students who could start

Successful startups

But they shouldn't

Just because you could start a successful

Startup doesn't mean you should cuz if you start a successful

Startup

Like

That means Lake

Do you know the foot lease in France

Fancy free days of your life are over

Hit that like your wallet for that company

We have funded

Kids in high school

Only because they're already gone

Like this

Like it's that we're not encouraging that I agree you think to go to HighSchool encourage kids to like

Do this incredibly hard thing instead of having fun in life

Like being kids that's

That's awful

I actually think that it's more mature optimization to write what you should be doing when you're in high school and even College

Is he should be figuring out what the options are rats picking one option and running with it

Right

And you know

It just turns out

That usually people who are in school

And then stop

To start companies

It's like you don't stare our dropouts from Harvard we know that classic

Examples

But if you have like if you drop out and just go do it and it's it you're on a path that's one thing but most people like

They're dabling and they have a fall back

That's not a good way to be a startup founder you have to be 100% committed

And so will fun people in college maybe even I slept there already clearly 100% committed

Otherwise know whatever Trent I think that Trend you're talking about is that is that you graduate from high school then why bother again

Getting a college degree because you're already on fantastic hacker

So I'm going to

How are you and if that person wants to enter the professional Workforce won't let that's great I don't know I was

I don't think I would it would have been good

It would have been good for me either but you know so I can start some start-up

I just think between 18 and 22

Grow a lot as a human being

Who's human inhumane and it's not clear what

But Society will turn into if we if all those folks

It's the workforce it's good to like mess around and do a whole bunch of different things in your early 20s if you could

Whether it's weather this messing around doing a whole bunch of things takes the form college or something else just like

Don't be careful because

Like starting a start-up is like

Catching a dragon by the tail if it works

Be careful at what point in your life you do that

Paul thank you very much

Forthcoming in

Are you deaf
