# Sam Altman - How to Succeed with a Startup

Okay

Today I'm going to talk about how to succeed with a startup

Obviously more than can be said here in 20 minutes but I will do the best I can

The most important thing

The number one lesson we try to teach startups

Is that the degree to which were successful

Approximates the degree to which you build a product that is so good

People spontaneously tell their friends about it

Startups always ask us for the secret to success they always want to believe it's something other than this

Because this is really hard to do

But this is a

If you can build a product that is so good people spontaneously tell their friends about it

You have done 80% of the work that you need

To be really successful startup

Did you think about the most successful companies you know

Google Facebook

Whatever

You probably find out about them because a friend of yours said

You got to try this it's great

So this is the bar

How many people love so much they tell their friends about it

What important

Indicator for a product like that is a product it's simple to explain

Easy to understand

If you can't explain in a few words what you do and if people don't at least some people don't say oh that's pretty interesting

That's usually a mistake it's usually a sign of unclear thinking

Or need that is not

Big enough

Another thing that startups need to look for

Is a market that is either started to undergo or soon going to undergo exponential growth

I think this is actually related to one of the biggest mistakes investors make

When evaluating startups

Investors always say we what's your grocery we care about the growth rate

Investors will forgive smallest Revenue today if it's growing quickly

For some reason people don't think about Market this way

But if you think about the most important startups

They are the ones that I start in small markets

They are growing very very quickly

11 years ago the market for iPhone apps $0 it's not huge

And I think if you only think about the time today

You make a big mistake

What you really want to do is identify a market that's going to grow

Every year

And be able to ride that up elevator

A really important thing to figure figuring this out

Is learning how to differentiate between real friends and fake friends

I'm a real trying to send me is actually going to happen if a train is not or at least not yet

And before you make a big bet on a new platform

You want to make sure it's real

Now there's an easy trick for this what y'all share now

Real Trends are ones where a new technology platform comes along

And the early adopters use it obsessively and tell their friends how much they love it

I think China's one were people made by the product

But don't use it

Really not enough

Example of a real trend

I already mentioned I want to mention that again

When the iPhone first came out many people were dismissive because they only sold a million or two million that year

And it said well this just doesn't matter

But for the people that had an iPhone they used it for hours every day became Central to their lives they loved it they told their friends you got

How to get one

And I think it was obvious then if you were paying attention

There's something fundamentally shifted

And we had a new a new Computing platform

Was going to spawn huge businesses

It was a good time to bet on mobile apps

I think trying to release a fake Trend at SSI August 2018

I would say it's br

I do believe you are will be big someday

But today most people that I know

But only VR headset use it never or very rarely

And although a lot of people talk about it and maybe even a lot of people buy them

There's not being tense usage per user

Among the early adopters that I think you want to see

Before you make a big butt

Another thing that startups need at least one Evangelical founder usually the CEO

Someone at the startup

Has got to be the person that is going to recruit

Sell the product

Talk to the Press

Raise money and this requires someone

Who can inspect

With enthusiasm

Are the whole world about what the company is trying to do

And someone who becomes the chief evangelist for the company

It's very hard to succeed wildly without that

It's very hard to build a team at all without being able to do that

One thing that helps for this is having an ambitious vision

You not going to be grandiose that turns people off

But you want to let yourself grow more ambitious overtime

And as long as you do that organically

People respond

And this is another exciting there fun to work on

In fact

I think in 2018 at least in Silicon Valley

It's easier to start a hard start up and it is starting to easy startup

Now that sounds paradoxical

Ambitious project for interesting

You know the current environment it may be relatively easy to raise Capital but it's really hard to do everything else there's so many Star

It's so easy to start one they all sound so promising

That I'll bring it together enough talent in one organization

It's really hard to do

And if you're working on a problem that you don't maybe modestly successful

It's it's kind of easy to get the first two people to join you can give them a lot of equity

But then it gets really hard

Why is employee 20 going to join why is this why does this matter to the world why should someone work on your startup

Versus any of the other things I could do

And picking some of the matters if you're successful is a great way to do that

And so

I think it's really important to think about

When you're starting a company

How is this going to evolve into a vision

Did a lot of people want to help with a lot of people

I want to be associated with

Because I think getting talented in mind share

It is really hard in the current environment

And

People are interested in start-up the matter

Another thing that we've noticed among our best Founders again and again and again

Is the day

At a confident and definite view of future

They may be wrong

It's a we say it's good to be confident flexible

But this idea that you are confident definition

This is what I think is going to happen or this is what is going to happen

And being relatively

Sure about having courage of your convictions

I'm being a clear leader saying we're going to do this

And that's why even in the face of a lot of doubt

That seems to really correlate with success

And this comes back to

Having an ambitious Vision but the entire startup ecosystem

Is best setup to support companies that

Have a low chance of success

But are huge if they work

And I think going for something that is huge if it works

Will attract the best people

I'm not going to talk too much about the team there a lot of obvious things I could say

It's been said many times by many people about you know you need smart people who want to work really hard and hookah mean

These are all really true

But I'd like to mention a few non-obvious things that we've noticed that we don't hear people say as much

About the team you need to assemble

The note also says that the team you build as the company you built and I really think that's true

I still

Met only a handful of Founders I think that's spend enough time on recruiting like Mark Zuckerberg is famously one of them

But building a great team

I think other than picking the right market and building a great product is the most important thing you do

All founders go through a transitional successful Founders were you switch from Building Product to building a company

And building a company really is about the team

So you need a optimist

The whole world

Will be telling you why you're going to fail to start up if you don't have that internal fire of police if you don't have people who say

You know what we are going to do this

And it doesn't matter what the haters say we're going to figure this out and there is

You know this problem it must be solvable

If you don't have the spirit of optimism on the team

It's very hard to succeed when the world continues to punch you in the face

You need at least some idea generators

There are a handful of people in any company that has gone on to be really successful but I have that I've been able to work

We're just really good at coming up with lots of ideas

You don't to many of these people because

That's more ideas than a company can follow through on

But having some people in a company

They're just constantly

Throwing out new ideas

Most of which will be bad

Turns out to be super important on the team

The spirit of will figure it out is my favorite thing to hear

Among early start a team members

A lot of things go wrong

The situations that starts when intended incredibly dynamic

And so this idea but even if I'm not qualified on paper even if I haven't solved this problem before

Even if this problem feels like it's going to kill the company which many problems will feel that way

The spirit among the team of

You know what we got the people we need we're going to figure this out we're going to get this done

That's super important

Another thing that I love to hear from early team members is I've got it

So

You know you here in big companies a lot of people say that's not my department someone else is going to do that

Yeah you know who this is really bad this is going to hurt us

And you want people to just step up and say I'll do it

I got it

Don't worry about it

You want people to have a bias towards action

Startups especially in the early days

Off and win by moving very quickly

You never get as much data as you'd like you never have as much time to deliberate as you'd like

And you want people

Poo

Will at are willing to act with

Much was dated may like to have with much less certainty

And it doesn't work they adapt really quickly and try something else

We talked also about the blessing of an experience we have seen many of our startup to incredible things

Because no one told them it was hard

No one told them they can't do it

On this great quote from Steve Wozniak

About all the best things I ever did came from having no experience whatsoever and having no money

And you know

That obviously is not always true

But there is a magic thing that happens with startups especially in the early days before they learn to not supposed to be able to do certain things

And so I think it's a startup

Again doesn't work that everybody being experienced

But you can take more bets than you normally would

On inexperienced but super high potential people

At the end of the topic on one team

One of the most important jobs you have the founder

Is to never lose momentum

And this is a little bit depressing because it means for the first few years you never got to take your foot off of it

The gas you never get to really rest

We try to be honest about this the startup they're not the best choice for work-life balance

At all

Especially in the early days

Startup survive on their own momentum

If you have momentum people keep

Delivering results beyond what they think they're capable of

If you lose momentum it's very difficult to get it back

And so

Continuing to make sure that the start of hand of the Cadence

That the startup keeps winning

A relatively productive relatively short and predictable intervals

This is really important and it's up to the founders to make sure that that you don't lose all of this

Another thing that

We think start to need is a competitive advantage over time

No this is something that sounds so obvious

I hesitated even put it in

This is well discussed

But we're seeing more and more startups

Apply to YC

I only ask them so what is the long-term

Monopolies affect your what is the long-term competitive advantage

What is you know where is the network effect in this business

They look at us like it's the first time we've ever they never heard this question

All of the really great businesses I know

Have an answer to this question

And in fact the better they are the more they pretend not to

But this is something that you you want to have a plan for

Another thing you want have a plan for at least a sensible business model

You don't have to have it all figured out the beginning

But when we ask Founders so how you ever going to make money

And they look at us like it's the first time they've ever been asked that question

Which happens more often than you would think recently

That's a bad sign to

Again this one is so common that I hesitate to put in here but when we ask a startup

How they're going to grow how they're going to get users

And they look at us like it's the first time they've ever had that question

That's fine

To some sensible idea to try here first

Pabu height once spent a bunch of time looking one of the YC partners

Asmita bunch of time looking at the traits of our best founders

And try to distill down what they were

And he came up with frugality Focus Obsession and love

I actually I think that is really good I don't have much to add

But I think these are things that

You should be able to say about what you're doing and you was a founder

And finally I want to talk about why startups get to be big companies

Weave

There are lots of reasons I'm going to talk about a few common ones here

I think these Trends are

Valuable enough that as you evaluate

Startup ideas you might do

It's worth thinking about if you fit into these

Because it's really hard for startups to beat big companies most of the time

And here's some areas where we see it

Happening repeatedly

So

I think one difference is if you are a product manager at a big company and you want to do something that sounds

Sounds like a bad idea but is a good idea

You have to get everybody from your boss sometimes all the way up to the CEO say yes

One no can kill you

If your startup

You can go to wifey.

Any number of the thousands of investors can say yes and you get to have a crack at it

It's a very different mindset

And for those ideas

That sound bad but are good

Because of this phenomenon this one no versus one yes

Startup screen win

In fact start up usually do big companies in that category of ideas

So look look for ideas that

Sound bad but are good

And where you are much more likely to get one yes

Then some of the big companies to get all yeses

Another area where startups

Usually big companies aren't very fast changing markets startups great speed

Great advantages in agility and speed the more Market is changing

Higher the number of decisions you get to make

An Indian bit higher number of tweaks to your product

And your strategy to get to make

And you want to optimize the number of those

Decisions

Someone has to make to compete with you

Because a big company

Will make them on average worse than certainly much slower than you do

So the speed of Market evolution

Gives you a lot more chances to compound

Your advantage over a big company

And then finally startups usually

When on a platform shifts

Many people have observed that startup companies clusters

Does clusters usually come after a big pot from shift

We'll stick with the iPhone example here

After

Mobile apps became a thing many new companies

Got started there now quite valuable

And one of the reasons here is

You know most large companies work on certain the annual Cadence at least

And when there's a huge platform shift

They are not good at making a big enough

Strategic pivot the battleship just turns to slowly

Where's the starter Penn State wow

Woke up this morning the world is fundamentally different than it was 6 months ago

We're going to go all in on this new Direction

And so that's the way that startups usually when

That's an ugly win

There are many others but

Thinking about these three I think it's

Is directional a good thing to do

Alright

That's all I got for today Jeff thank you very much for having me and for the class
