# Suhail Doshi - How to Measure Your Product

https://www.startupschool.org/videos/39

We are very grateful to have Suhail Doshi from MixPanel who co-founded MixPanel almost 10 years ago now and is going to talk about how to measure your product which as you heard from Gustaf is really the other side of the coin of growth and everything that helps you build something that people truly want and will use. With that, Suhail.

我们非常感谢来自MixPanel的SuhailDoshi，他在大约10年前与人共同创建了MixPanel，我们将讨论如何衡量您的产品，正如您从Gustaf那里听到的那样，这确实是增长硬币的另一面，也是帮助您构建人们真正想要并将会使用的东西的一切。

Suhail Doshi: All right. Hello, everyone.

大家好。

I'm happy to be here. Awesome.

我很高兴来到这里。好极了。

I thought I would start off by just kind of like, I sometimes try to change my presentation a little bit on the fly depending on the audience.

我想我可以从这样的方式开始，我有时会根据观众的不同，尝试改变一下我的演讲方式。

I thought I would just ask like a really quick question, just a quick show of hands, I'm going to define like a user as like, just someone that uses your product, whether it's ... Whether a B to B company, paying free, it doesn't really matter like they did something in your product. How many people have like zero users right now? Okay, cool awesome. How many people have 100 or less? Well, okay, you have greater than zero between one and 100. Okay, awesome, great and then how many of you have like more than 10,000? Okay, awesome, all right so we've got ...

我想我会问一个非常简单的问题，快速的举手调查，我会给出一个定义，就像一个用户，一个使用你的产品的人，不管它是。。。是不是B对B公司，免费付费，这并不重要，就像他们在你的产品中做了什么一样。现在有多少人没有用户? 好吧，酷太棒了。有多少人有100或更少? 好吧，好吧，你在1到100之间有大于0的。好的，太棒了，那么你们有多少人超过一万人呢? 好吧，太棒了，我们有。。。

I'd say, majority of people have zero users right now. Cool. Awesome, great.

我得说，大多数人现在没有用户。很好。棒极了，太棒了。

I'm going to start off with just a quick about me for those who haven't heard of MixPanel, I started this company called MixPanel, I think the first line of code was written in like October 2008 technically. I was like 20 years old.

首先，我要为那些从未听说过MixPanel的人介绍一下我，我创建了一家名为MixPanel的公司，第一行代码在技术上是在2008年10月编写的。我那时大概20岁。

I was in my parent's house in my bedroom and 10 years later, the company has about 300 employees. We've raised a bunch of money and we have about 7,000 paying customers and we're starting to close in on around 100 million dollars in annual recurring revenue, just to give you a sense of yeah 2008 now. Cool. Awesome.

我在我父母的家里，在我的卧室。10年后，公司有大约300名员工。我们已经筹集了一大笔资金，我们有大约7000个付费客户，我们正开始接近每年1亿美元的经常性收入，只是给你一种大概的感觉，是的，2008年。很好。好极了。

If you don't know what MixPanel is, we make pretty graphs like this. We help you measure what people are doing inside the product so this is like, someone inviting a colleague to their app. We might help you like measure a funnel and see the conversion rate of people opening your app to like viewing an article, we'll help you measure retention.

如果你不知道MixPanel是什么，我们会制作出这样漂亮的图形。我们帮助你测量人们在产品里面做什么，所以这就像是有人邀请一个同事来他们的应用程序。我们可能会帮助您测量漏斗，并看到人们打开您的应用程序喜欢看文章的转换率，我们将帮助您测量留存。

I know Gustaf went over that a little bit today.

我知道古斯塔夫今天说过了。

I'm just showing you this just because like everything that I talk about today is basically ...

我给你看这个只是因为就像我今天说的每件事。。。

Is something that you could probably do in MixPanel or even any other tool. There are a bunch of tools that are great to measure these things but I want you to know that if you walk out the door and you wanted to apply in a bit, you totally could. There's like a premium plan and we cater very much to startups, those are all of our early customers so feel free to do that. Awesome. Great. Today, what I wanted to dive into was I thought I would take a top-down approach to thinking about analytics and metrics, instead of kind of coming at you with charts and visualizations and numbers and things like, I thought it would be better to kind of think about the problem that you're trying to actually solve and sort of ignore for a moment that you have to do complex analysis and calculations. You will figure that out.

是在MixPanel中，甚至在任何其他工具中都可以实现的功能。有很多工具可以很好的测量这些东西，但是我想让你知道，如果你走出家门，你想申请一些，你完全可以。有一个优质的计划，我们非常迎合初创公司，这些都是我们的早期客户，所以请随意这样做。好极了。好极了。今天，我想深入探讨的是，我认为我应该采取自上而下的方法来思考分析和度量，而不是带着图表，可视化和数字之类的东西来找你，我认为，最好考虑一下你试图真正解决的问题，然后暂时忽略一些你不得不做的复杂分析和计算的问题。你会想出办法的。

It's not hard or you'll just use tools that will make that a lot easier for you. That's one thing that I thought I would do.

这并不难，否则你只需要使用一些工具就可以让你轻松很多。这是我想要做的一件事。

I picked these three things.

我选了这三件事。

I tried to think pretty hard about like, what the heck did I care about when I started a company, like what matter to me? What was on my mind? I thought, well, I think the first thing is just like do people even understand what I made and MixPanel had a really hard time with that in its first 18 months. We had to change a lot of things and most people do. The second thing is, okay, great, they kind of understand what it is but do they find it relatively easy to use the product on day one? That's kind of this never ending mission that you'll end up taking when you start your company and when you ship your product. The last thing is, I kind of try to pair it down a little bit but I thought the most important thing would be the next, are people coming back and using my product? I think that you'll find that like ...

我很努力地想，当我开公司的时候，我到底在乎什么，像什么对我来说很重要? 我在想什么? 我想，嗯，我想第一件事就是，就像人们都知道我做了什么一样，在最初的18个月里，MixPanel经历了一段非常艰难的时光。我们不得不改变很多事情，大多数人都是这样做的。第二件事是，好吧，太好了，他们有点明白这是什么，但是他们觉得在第一天使用产品相对容易吗? 这是一种永无休止的任务，你最终将承担当你开始你的公司和当你发货你的产品。最后一件事是，我试着把它配对一下，但我认为最重要的是下一件事，人们回来使用我的产品吗? 我想你会发现就像。。。

I know Gustaf talked about this and I'm going to be extremely repetitive because this is one of the most important things that early founders make a mistake with. Yeah, so from there, I thought that I would try to also ...

我知道古斯塔夫说过这件事，我将非常重复，因为这是早期创业者犯错的最重要的事情之一。是的，所以从那里，我想我也会试着。。。

I thought that it will also be helpful for you to see, it kind of broken down in a formula. This is the formula and I like to think about things from first principles, right? What are the things that would cause you to grow? They're pretty simple, right? There's just like people that visit some page or the app, right, basic, you experience this everyday and then there's like people that sign up and then of those people, who did something ... How many of those people did something valuable like watching a video or making a recipe or taking a scooter, a scooter ride. Then, of the people, how many of those people end up coming back some period of time later and then how many people will like spread that product, like tell a friend, share it, maybe even have a sales team, who knows, right? These five things is like basically equal growth and these are your levers. The thing that I want to kind of point out and I want to stress is that, today, I'm going to cover the basics but I want to kind of impart on you that, the basics are really important. Even thousand person companies get the basics wrong.

我想它也会对你有帮助，它在某种程度上分解成一个公式。这就是公式，我喜欢从第一原则来思考问题，对吗? 什么东西会让你成长? 很简单，对吧? 就像那些访问某个页面或应用程序的人一样，对，基本的，你每天都有这样的经历，然后就像那些注册的人，然后是那些做了一些事情的人……有多少人做了一些有价值的事情，比如看了一段视频，制作了一个食谱或者骑了一辆滑板车，骑了一辆滑板车。那么，在人们当中，有多少人最终会在一段时间后回来，那么有多少人会喜欢传播这种产品，比如告诉朋友，分享，甚至可能有一个销售团队，谁知道呢，对吗? 这五件事就像是基本相等的成长，这些就是你的杠杆。我想指出的是，今天我要讲的是，基本知识，但是我想告诉你们，基本知识是非常重要的。即使是千人公司也会犯基本错误。

In fact, you'll find that if you don't get ... Even these thousand person companies like get it wrong, they tend to over-complicate the number of things that they should actually measure and track and it's really easy to make 25 metrics conceive of them, align them, divide them all by ... Give each team five and then really over-complicate something that is actually quite simple to do and when you over-complicate it, what happens is that companies, even large companies have immediate paralysis. Even mid-sized large companies have this like decision making problem.

事实上，你会发现，如果你得不到。。。即使有上千家公司喜欢犯错，它们也往往会使实际应该测量和跟踪的事情的数量变得过于复杂，而且很容易让25个指标对其进行设想，对其进行调整，然后将它们全部分开。。。。。。。。给每个团队五个指标，然后真的变得过于复杂了。即使是中等规模的大公司也有类似的决策问题。

I used to have this funny phrase at MixPanel where I used to say that all data is like contestable. You could like see this number go off into the right, and you go, "Well, I don't know, it was like sunny outside and like ..." and that's why people did it and people like have these arguments no matter what because causation is really hard to discover. What I find is that, just picking like three to five things, a north star and really simplifying it will do more good for you and I know because not only have I watched thousands of companies make this mistake at all sizes, I have made this mistake.

在MixPanel中，我经常说所有的数据都是可竞争的。你可以看到这个数字向正确的方向移动，然后你就会说，“我不知道，外面就像是阳光灿烂，就像。。。”这就是为什么人们这么做，人们喜欢争论，不管发生什么，因为因果关系真的很难发现。我发现，选择三到五件事，一颗北极星，真正简化它，对你会有更大的好处，我知道，因为我不仅目睹了成千上万家公司在不同规模上犯了这一错误，而且我也犯了这一错误。

I had a piece of paper that had like 25 sub-metrics and it was nearly impossible to actually keep track of it and people end up doing is in reality, what people care about is there are metrics that guide the team and there are metrics that help you monitor and assess if anything is going wrong and today, we're going to talk about things that guide the team, okay? Cool. Great. With this formula, you should be able to assess anything going wrong in the company, right? If you have a really confusing landing page, you should be able to figure that out.

我有一张有25个子指标的纸，几乎不可能真正跟踪它，人们最终所做的是在现实中，人们关心的是指导团队的指标，还有一些指标可以帮助你监控和评估是否出了什么问题，今天，我们将讨论指导团队的事情，好吗? 很好。好极了。有了这个公式，你应该能够评估公司出了什么问题，对吗? 如果你有一个真正令人困惑的网页，你应该能够解决这个问题。

If your sign up process is too difficult, you should be able to figure that out.

如果你的注册过程太困难，你应该能够解决这个问题。

If you have a product that people don't really value, you will figure that out with just that formula.

如果你有一个人们并不真正重视的产品，你会用这个公式来计算出来。

It's just that simple and you can get more complicated after that, right? You could say, okay, landing page views are down all of a sudden, why? Is it ... Let me look at that segmented by country, maybe something happened, maybe I changed something in a different country. You should be able to assess any reason why you're not growing just starting out with that. That's why I say, starting simple will last a very long time. This is what it looks like, right? Linking those two ideas together, you have this funnel of people, going from visits to eventually retaining and spreading the product and like on each one of these things, you're trying to basically solve one of these three problems.

就这么简单，之后你会变得更复杂，对吧? 你可以说，好吧，登陆页面浏览量突然下降了，为什么? 是不是。。。让我看看这个被分割的国家，也许发生了什么，也许我在另一个国家改变了什么。你应该能够评估你为什么不从一开始就成长的原因。这就是为什么我说，简单的开始会持续很长时间。看起来是这样，对吧? 将这两个想法联系在一起，你就会有这样一个漏斗，从访问到最终留存和传播产品，就像这些事情中的每一个一样，你试图从根本上解决这三个问题中的一个。

Is it easy to understand? Is it easy to get started? Are people coming back because they find it valuable, and then it loops and the funny thing about this is, even if you're like Airbnb and you have thousands and thousands of people, this process of optimizing each one of these steps is never ending, no matter what scale you're at, you'll always be changing something and you probably have competition so you have no choice. Awesome, and then once you are able to measure those five things and assess what's wrong, you have your levers and you should be able to take action and fix any of those things, put a team on it, maybe you're fixing it.

这容易理解吗? 开始容易吗? 人们回来是因为他们发现它很有价值，然后它循环，有趣的是，即使你像Airbnb一样，你有成千上万的人，这个优化每一步的过程永远不会结束，不管你处于什么规模，你总是在改变一些东西，你可能会有竞争，所以你没有选择。很棒，然后一旦你能够衡量这五件事，评估出了什么问题，你就有了你的杠杆，你应该能够采取行动，解决任何问题，组建一个团队，也许你正在修复它。

It is really that simple. Awesome. We're going to start with the first thing which is, is my product easy to understand? In order to illustrate this idea, I decided that it would be somewhat sympathetic because I could show you like, really awesome landing pages of like great companies or I could just show you like what it's like to start out.

就这么简单。好极了。我们首先要说的是，我的产品容易理解吗? 为了说明这个想法，我决定，它会有点同情，因为我可以向你展示喜欢，非常棒的大公司的网页，或者我可以向你展示它是什么样子的开始。

I also wanted to mention that having a really bad landing page, there's this really awesome quote that PG used to have in our batch that I thought I would impart in you, which is that like, people basically just have their mouse hovering on the back button and they're just waiting to say, "I don't know what this is, it's confusing，" back. That's immediately how most companies are just losing most of their uses from moving on. Just remember that your enemy is the back button. This is what MixPanel's first front page look like in 2009. That's not what our logo looks like anymore. This is a design by me, original design by me and in all of its glory, if like actually go review the words, there's like tons of grammatical mistakes because I was horrible at writing. For some reason in my mind, I thought, "I know what the tagline for the company should be. Metrics that will make you drool." I guess, I think the reason why was because I thought these graphs were like so pretty looking compared to what was out there, that I thought like that would be the value proposition of a company. Of course, this is like totally wrong, like you'll all laugh.

我还想提一下，有一个非常糟糕的登陆页，有一个非常棒的引用，在我们的一批PG曾经有，我认为我会告诉你，这是说，就像，人们基本上只是有他们的鼠标悬停在后面的按钮，他们只是在等待说，“我不知道这是什么，它是混乱的，”回来。这就是为什么大多数公司正在失去他们的大部分用途，因为继续前进。只要记住你的敌人是后面的按钮。这就是MixPanel在2009年的第一个头版的样子。那不是我们的标志了。这是我的一个设计，最初的设计是我设计的，在它所有的荣耀里，如果真的去复习单词，就会有很多语法错误，因为我不擅长写作。出于某种原因，我想，“我知道公司的口号应该是什么。衡量标准会让你流口水。” 我想，我之所以这么想，是因为我认为这些图和外面的图相比看起来非常漂亮，所以我认为这将是一个公司的价值主张。当然，这是完全错误的，你们都会笑的。

I wish I could have like made this landing page, presented it to you and then you'd all laugh at me and I'm like, "Okay, I should change that thing." I didn't have that.

我真希望我能制作一个登陆页面，把它呈现给你，然后你就会嘲笑我，我就会说，“好吧，我应该换一个。” 我没有。

I had zero users at the time and yeah, I tried to target small startup big company.

当时我的用户是零，是的，我试图瞄准小的初创大公司。

I didn't know who I was targeting, application developer, I'm like trying to target everybody.

我不知道我在瞄准谁，应用程序开发人员，我就像是试图瞄准每个人。

I think this is ... Every mistake that one could make on a landing page is like right here, right, like the sign up button. At least I kind of got that right. Thank you Adora for teaching me how to optimize buttons at slide.

我想这是。。。每一个在登陆页上可能犯的错误就像这里，对，就像注册按钮。至少我说对了。谢谢阿多拉教我如何在幻灯片上优化按钮。

I made it like yellow but that's about maybe all that I got right, right? Just maybe roughly the sign up button. Then, after a lot of work, a lot of hard work, a lot of iteration, a lot of talking to customers, a lot of measurement, eventually a couple of years later, it kind of turned into this, right? I like, manage to get like the logo right. The sign up button is like ginormous and yellow. What we figured out though after a lot of time and a lot of energy was that we transformed from metrics that will make you drool to action speaks louder than page views and you'll notice it's like extremely prominent, the reason why was because the number one question that we would get as a company was, that's cool but like how are you different than Google Analytics, I don't get it, right? It turned out like this tagline for us at the front page, lasted like the next five years of the company and because it very much differentiated us as something where we would measure engagement, we did something different like Google was about page views, we were about like, what people did in your app and that resonated and then, from there, we tried to explain like what various ... We tried to urge people to go down the website and like look at different features and see if those things were valuable. We try to be benefits oriented in the copy, tried to show customers and case studies who maybe found it valuable. We probably made like four changes after this.

我把它做得像黄色，但这大概是我的全部，对吗? 大概是注册按钮吧。那么，经过大量的工作，大量的艰苦工作，大量的迭代，大量的与客户的交谈，大量的测量，最终几年后，它变成了这样，对吗? 我喜欢，设法弄到像标志一样的权利。注册按钮就像Ginormous和黄色。不过，经过大量的时间和精力之后，我们发现，我们从那些让你流口水的指标转变为行动的指标，比页面浏览量还要重要，你会发现这一点非常突出，原因是作为一个公司，我们会遇到的第一个问题是，这很酷，但就像你和谷歌分析有什么不同一样，我不明白，对吗? 结果它就像我们在头版的这条标语，就像公司的未来五年一样，因为它把我们区分为一个我们可以衡量的东西，我们做了一些不同的事情，像谷歌是关于页面浏览量，我们是关于人们在你的应用程序中所做的事情，然后，从那里，我们试图解释各种各样的东西。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。我们试图敦促人们浏览网站，看看不同的功能，看看是否有价值。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。我们试图在副本中以利益为导向，试图向客户和案例研究谁可能发现它的价值。在这之后我们可能做了四个改变。

I thought I'd present this one just because it was the one that maybe lasted, like the copy and the general essence of what we did and what we said we did, kind of stayed the same largely but lots of design changes. The real question is, great, so like how do I measure ... How did you measure whether people really understood ... Whether they understood what you were doing.

我想我会提出这一个，只是因为它可能是一个持续的，就像复制和一般的本质，我们所做的和我们所说的一样，基本上保持不变，但很多设计变更。真正的问题是，太好了，所以我怎么衡量。。。你怎么衡量人们是否真正理解。。。他们是否理解你在做什么。

I think there is like one tried and shared number.

我认为有一个尝试和共享的号码。

It's like very simple, it's just did people even bother to sign up? Bothering to sign up doesn't mean that they're going to use your product. That's a whole different matter. Bothering to sign up is like, "I don't know, I'm kind of interested, I mean, I'll kick the tires. This seems kind of interesting and cool to me." That'll tell you a lot about whether what you're doing is even something valuable for people. The second thing that you can try, these are just ideas, trying to find the ratio of people that are going from just like hitting your page, right and then doing any kind of thing after that. Instead of SAKA, instead of hitting the back button, right, like did they click on segmentation or funnels or attention in that case, did they bother to do that? I know there are a lot of B to B companies. Actually, one quick question, how many people are making like a B to B company? Yeah, great so it's about half of the room so I thought I'd give a B to B slant. One thing that I discover was that people ... A lot of your user will click on a pricing page link at the top.

就像很简单，只是人们还费心去报名吗? 费心去注册并不意味着他们会使用你的产品。那是完全不同的事情。“我不知道，我有兴趣，我的意思是，我会踢轮胎。这对我来说似乎很有趣，很酷。” 这会告诉你，你所做的事情对人们来说是否有价值。第二件事，你可以尝试，这些只是想法，试图找到的人的比例，就像击中你的网页，对，然后做任何类型的事情之后。而不是Saka，而不是点击后退按钮，对吗，就像在这种情况下，他们点击了分段，漏斗或注意力，他们费心去做了吗? 我知道有很多B到B的公司。其实，一个简单的问题是，有多少人在做一个B对B的公司? 是的，很好，所以这是房间的一半，所以我想我应该把B换成B。我发现的一件事是人们。。。很多用户会点击顶部的价格页面链接。

It's like second or third like most clicked on link if you're a B to B I think, generally speaking.

就像第二个或第三个，就像大多数点击链接，如果你是B到B，我想，一般来说。

I think ... This is totally contestable but I find that people clicking on your pricing page is like actually pretty decent indicator of like, "Okay, cool, you have something kind of valuable, okay, how much?" Even something like that I think can tell you a lot. Then, if you're a consumer, the benefit of being a consumer is that you generally have ... Usually will have like hundreds or thousands of users such that you could actually go do an AB test whereas in B to B it's a lot harder to achieve that.

我认为。。。这是完全有争议的，但我发现，人们点击你的定价页面实际上是相当不错的指标，就像，“好吧，酷，你有一些有价值的东西，好吧，多少钱?” 即使是这样的事情，我想也能告诉你很多。然后，如果你是一个消费者，那么成为一个消费者的好处是，你通常有。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。通常

I really ...

我真的…。

I think Gustaf is absolutely right that you should try to conduct as many experiments as you can and really AB test your copywriting and find out like what resonates with people. These are all things that you can do to basically figure out, is this easy? Cool. The second one is well, is it easy to get started with my product and the thing about this is like, a lot of people ... The thing about these first two things is that, if you don't make the first step easy, if it's easy to understand, a lot of people put so much energy, when we're trying to build a company, we try to think about like all the cool features and things that we could make that would be really valuable for customers. The problem with that is like if you don't even get step one right, you don't even have a chance at any of the subsequent steps. When we think about like, is it easy to get started with my product ... Forgot about password is kind of a useless feature.

我认为古斯塔夫是绝对正确的，你应该尝试进行尽可能多的实验，并真正的AB测试你的文案，找出什么共鸣的人。这些都是你能做的事情，你能从根本上弄清楚，这简单吗? 很好。第二个是好的，我的产品很容易上手，这是关于很多人的事情。。。前两件事是，如果你不让第一步变得简单，如果容易理解，很多人投入了那么多精力，当我们试图建立一个公司，我们试图想像所有的酷功能和事情，我们可以使它真正有价值的客户。这样做的问题是，如果你的步骤一不正确，你甚至没有机会在任何后续的步骤。当我们想到喜欢，是不是很容易开始与我的产品。。。忘记密码是一种无用的功能。

If you have like a very small percentage of people that are basically not even bothering to get started.

如果你喜欢一个很小的比例的人，基本上根本不想要开始。

In fact, I remember there is a YC company called Zenter which turned into like Google Slides.

事实上，我记得有一家名为Zenter的YC公司，它变成了谷歌的幻灯片。

I remember Robbie Walker during one of our Tuesday dinner said, that they didn't even implement the save button for like their online PowerPoint because they knew that none of their users whatever ask, like, "Hey, can I save this，" they just didn't even bother to do it because they wanted to see would anyone even use the PowerPoint presentation products. When they imparted that on me, I was like, "Wow, that's crazy，" and for like, I don't know maybe like 18 months of MixPanel, we didn't even have forgot about password because we were just so ruthlessly trying to prioritize like things that would really matter to customers.

我记得RobbieWalker在周二的一次晚宴上说，他们甚至没有实现像他们的在线PowerPoint一样的保存按钮，因为他们知道他们的用户中没有任何一个会问，“嘿，我能保存这个吗?”他们甚至懒得这样做，因为他们想看看是否有人会使用PowerPoint演示产品。当他们告诉我，“哇，这太疯狂了，”就像，我不知道，也许像18个月的混合面板，我们甚至没有忘记密码，因为我们是如此无情地试图优先考虑的事情，将真正重要的客户。

It turned out we didn't get many request anyway. This is really important and here's an example of easy to use, something you use every single day. That is literally one step. You just go to Google, you type it in and you immediately get to use the product. There's no sign up, there's no captchas, there's none of that, right? A more complex example is like Airbnb who might have like 10 steps or something like that. We worked with Airbnb for a while, helping them optimize initial user experience. Even though Airbnb probably has like 11 pages of ... You have to go to Airbnb and then you have to fill out this form and then you get taken to the results and then you click on those results and then you click on many different results because you're trying to price compare and you're going through this very complex check out process so there are actually many steps to booking something online. Airbnb had to kind of figure out like, how do we A, describe what we're doing, what we offer, what's useful for the world and B, how do we help people get started as quickly and as easy as possible. This is Airbnb.com right now and they have this very simple like, "Book unique homes and experiences this，" you fill out this very basic things and you hit search and that's it. That's their getting started experience.

结果我们没有收到太多的请求。这真的很重要，这里有一个简单易用的例子，你每天都要用到的东西。这简直就是一步。你只要去谷歌，你键入它，你马上就可以使用该产品。没有注册，没有卡查斯，没有那个，对吧? 一个更复杂的例子是Airbnb，他可能有10个步骤或者类似的东西。我们与Airbnb合作了一段时间，帮助他们优化初始用户体验。虽然airbnb可能有大约11页的。。。你必须去airbnb，然后你必须填写这个表格，然后你得到结果，然后你点击那些结果，然后你点击许多不同的结果，因为你试图价格比较，你正在经历这个非常复杂的退房过程，所以实际上有很多步骤来在线预订东西。Airbnb必须弄清楚，我们如何，描述我们正在做什么，我们提供什么，什么对世界有用，我们如何帮助人们尽快和尽可能简单地开始。现在这是Airbnb.com，他们有一个非常简单的例子，“预订独特的房子，体验这个”，你填好这个非常基本的东西，然后点击搜索，就这样。那是他们开始的经验。

It's not their entire flow but it's the first way to get started. They even try to like kind of impute something like what you might be able to find, something they manage to have on Airbnb. The thing is that, this seems simple, right? This seems like something that you could just like easily make, it doesn't take ... How hard is that, right? You can do that with Twitter bootstrap in no time. The problem, the thing that's really hard is like, figuring out that that's the right thing, that's really hard. That takes like ... they probably change that 50 times before they figured out, this is the right current optimal thing at this stage for the company.

这不是他们的全部，但这是开始的第一条路。他们甚至试图把你可能找到的东西归为某种东西，或者他们在Airbnb上找到的东西。问题是，这看起来很简单，对吧? 这看起来像是你可以很容易地做的东西，它不需要。。。这有多难，对吧? 你可以在任何时候使用推特引导程序来做到这一点。问题是，真正困难的事情是，弄清楚这是正确的事情，真的很难。就像。。。他们可能改变了50倍，然后他们发现，这是正确的当前最佳的事情，在这个阶段的公司。

It takes a lot of work and you have to grind very hard to get to this point. The question is like, "Okay great, so how do you ... How would you measure something like that?" Well, I think the really simple answer is a funnel. How many people go from a landing page to signing up, to doing that valuable thing like watching a video, doing ...

这需要大量的工作，你必须非常努力，以达到这一点。问题是，“好吧，太好了，你怎么。。。你怎么来衡量这样的东西?” 嗯，我想最简单的答案是漏斗。有多少人从一个登陆页面去注册，去做那些有价值的事情，比如看一段视频，做。。。

In Airbnb's case, it would have been just doing a search, just one search at least. Once you get past that, measuring your funnel for the entire initial user experience.

在Airbnb的案例中，它可能只是进行了一次搜索，至少是一次搜索。一旦你通过了，测量你的漏斗为整个最初的用户体验。

It's like, where things were like, there's actually situations in games, games can have like 20 steps and I've seen hundred of gaming company's funnels and even though they might have like 20 or 30 steps, sometimes you can ... They actually convert very highly, like they might get like 80, 90% conversion rate through all those 20 steps. Just the first two are like actually the ones that have the greatest drop off. The last thing is just like actually speed. This is one that I think a lot of people don't actually do.

就像，在游戏中，有20个步骤，我见过很多游戏公司的漏斗，即使它们有20到30个步骤，有时你也可以。。。它们的转换速度非常高，就像它们在这20个步骤中的转换速度达到80%，90%一样。仅仅是前两个，实际上是那些有最大的下降。最后一件事就像实际上的速度。这是一个我认为很多人并不真正这样做。

It's just like how fast can someone just get started and that will tell you a lot about how complicated your experience is. Sometimes slow is okay, it depends on the business but speed is really important. Does it take them like five minutes to get something figured out or does it take a minute? In MixPanel's case, we cared a lot about like ... We had a complicated flow, not only do you have to sign up but you had to be able to have the right code.

这就像是一个人刚开始的时候有多快，这会告诉你很多关于你的经历是多么的复杂。有时慢是可以的，这取决于业务，但速度真的很重要。他们是要花五分钟才能想出办法呢，还是要花一分钟的时间? 在MixPanel的例子中，我们非常关心的是。。。我们有一个复杂的流程，不仅需要注册，而且还需要有正确的代码。

It's just really complicated and that was the one downside, we weren't really sure, where people ... With Google Analytics, you just copy and paste the Javascript, with MixPanel, you have to like actually go and track a line of code. We had this question in our mind, was that easy enough? Speed became really important to us. How fast can someone do that.

这真的很复杂，这是一个缺点，我们不确定人们。。。使用谷歌分析，你只需要复制和粘贴JavaScript，使用MixPanel，你必须喜欢实际去跟踪一行代码。我们心里就有这个问题，是不是很简单? 速度变得对我们非常重要。有人能多快。

I wanted to give you a couple tips and tricks. Things that I have seen that companies do that are generally like not great. Number one you're a startup. You don't have lots of fraud problems. You don't have ... You probably don't have a lot of people spamming your service. You probably don't have a lot of like fake actors in the system trying to sign up.

我想给你一些提示和技巧。我所看到的公司所做的事情一般都不是很好。第一，你是个初创公司。你没有太多的欺诈问题。你没有。。。你可能没有很多人在为你服务。你可能不会有太多像假演员一样的人在系统中尝试注册。

If you don't have those problems, don't optimize for them until you do and I just want you to know that generally, email and text confirmations have an enormous drop off.

如果你没有这些问题，不要为他们优化，直到你做，我只想让你知道，一般来说，电子邮件和文本确认有一个巨大的下降。

I'm talking like, you get ... Of the 100% of the people that come like only 30% will basically go on and click on those email confirmations or 40%. You spend a lot of time trying to optimize that and then to even make matters even worst, like you have to hope to God that isn't go to spam.

我说的是，在100%的人中，只有30%的人会去点击那些邮件确认，或者40%。你花了很多时间试图优化它，然后甚至使事情变得更糟，就像你必须希望上帝不会去垃圾邮件。

It's this really horrendous experience. Just be really careful, you'll lose a lot of users that way.

这真是可怕的经历。只是要非常小心，那样你会失去很多用户。

It's really important to iterate on your initial user experience. That will be a never ending process. You will do this forever. Even as ... Especially as the product changes and it becomes really critical to like have someone on it so at least one responsible person just thinking about that all the time. Then, the last thing is, not every company, not every product is capable of doing this but to the extent that you can just let users into the product, it's always better to do that.

对您的初始用户体验进行迭代是非常重要的。这将是一个永无止境的过程。你会永远这样做的。即使。。。特别是随着产品的变化，喜欢上一个人变得非常重要，所以至少有一个负责任的人一直在想这个问题。然后，最后一件事是，不是每个公司，不是每个产品都有能力做到这一点，但在一定程度上，你可以让用户进入产品，这总是更好的做法。

In MixPanel's case, it wasn't possible because like we needed to get your data so you have to sign up but we experimented with like what if someone just copied and pasted the Javascript but they didn't sign up and we just collected their data and then after that, we like asked them to sign up? We did experiments like that so, to the extent that you can achieve this, that's awesome and good examples of this are actually like Airbnb and Google where you just try it but there are always exceptions to these rules. For example, like Pinterest makes you sign up. They didn't used to but they do now and there are good reasons for that. Then, the last one, definitely not the least, are people coming back? To me this is probably one of the metrics that is greatly ignored by most startups and it's often the reason why I've seen companies even with millions of users actually die.

在MixPanel的例子中，这是不可能的，因为就像我们需要获取数据一样，所以您必须注册，但是我们进行了这样的实验，如果有人只是复制并粘贴了JavaScript，但他们没有注册，我们只是收集了他们的数据，然后，我们要求他们注册。我们做了这样的实验，所以，只要你能做到这一点，这是很棒的，很好的例子，实际上就像Airbnb和Google一样，你只需要尝试一下，但是这些规则总是有例外的。例如，像Pinterest让你注册。他们以前不喜欢，但现在有了，有很好的理由。那么，最后一个，绝对不是最不重要的，人们还会回来吗? 对我来说，这可能是大多数初创公司都忽略不计的指标之一，这也是我看到公司甚至有数百万用户真正死亡的原因。

I've seen probably 15 different companies that grew virally and then just died. The company died.

我见过可能有15家不同的公司，它们都是以病毒的方式成长起来的，然后就死了。公司死了。

I want to demonstrate this in a graph.

我想在图表中演示这一点。

I called this the shark fin effect. The reason why I call it the shark fin effect is because, well, one was because MixPanel ...

我把这叫做鱼翅效应。我之所以称它为鱼翅效应是因为，嗯，其中一个是因为。。。

In MixPanel, the default line color for your first data point is blue and it always ... To me it always look like a fin in the water and it looked a lot like this and what happens is you're slaving away and you find a way to go viral, right? Maybe you're going super viral on Facebook or Instagram or something and you're like, "Wow, I have struck gold. I am acquiring tons of users, my life is awesome, I'm going to be a billionaire, it's great，" right? The problem with this is, is that if it happens too early but you didn't quite think about retention it becomes really problematic and this hurts companies. Basically, what happens is the app goes viral and then eventually, the rate at which you're losing users becomes high enough that you can't acquire the new ones.

在MixPanel中，第一个数据点的默认行Color是蓝色的，它总是。。。在我看来，它总是像一个鳍在水中，它看起来很像这样，发生了什么，你正在拼命工作，你找到了一个方法去传播病毒，对吗? 也许你会在Facebook或Instagram上走红，然后你会说，“哇，我已经赚了很多钱了，我的生活太棒了，我会成为一个亿万富翁，这很棒，对吧?” 这方面的问题是，如果它发生得太早，但你没有完全考虑到留存，它变得真正的问题，这伤害了公司。基本上，这个应用程序会变得非常流行，最终，你失去用户的速度会变得非常高，以至于你无法获得新的用户。

It turns out that like, even though we like to try to be extremely rational people, it's really hard because like when the app is going viral, you're just like, "Oh my God, I need to like ... Just take advantage of this moment." "What if I don't get it and what if my competitor finds it so I'm just going to optimize, optimize, optimize." It turns out that it ends up not being very valuable because if you're just losing all the users, it's really, really hard to reactivate.

事实证明，即使我们想要成为一个非常理性的人，这真的很难，因为就像当应用程序正在流行的时候，你就会说，“哦，天啊，我需要喜欢。。。好好利用这一刻。” “如果我没有得到它，如果我的竞争对手发现了它，那么我将进行优化，优化，优化。” 事实证明，它最终并不是很有价值，因为如果你只是失去了所有的用户，它真的，真的很难重新激活。

If you talk to people that have ever done like a reactivation campaign, reactivation campaigns generally don't go very well. You usually just like lose those users until they decide that maybe they want to give the product a second chance.

如果你和那些曾经像重新激活运动那样做过的人交谈，重新激活运动通常不会很顺利。你通常喜欢失去那些用户，直到他们决定也许他们想给产品第二次机会。

It's not like, your response is like ... When this happens, a lot of people's response is like, "Oh we lost the users because our app wasn't valuable." "Let's just email them again and see if they'll come back." That's seriously not a great idea.

这并不是说，你的反应就像。。。当这种情况发生时，很多人的反应是，“哦，我们失去了用户，因为我们的应用程序没有价值。” “让我们再给他们发一封邮件，看看他们会不会回来。” 真的不是个好主意。

It can be really ... it's really important to really think through retention and you really don't want to be like this guy. The shark fin effect is really, really bad.

它可以是真的。。。这是真的很重要，考虑到留存，你真的不想成为这样的人。鱼翅效应真的，真的很糟糕。

In fact LivingSocial is a great example. A lot of people don't know that like LivingSocial is basically this app that was on Facebook that had nothing to do with like the Groupon, deal cutting thing and they went super viral on ...

事实上，LivingSocial就是一个很好的例子。很多人不知道，像LivingSocial这样的应用程序基本上就是Facebook上的一个与Groupon无关的应用程序。

I can't remember exactly what the product was. LivingSocial literally had to pivot the entire company to basically competing with Groupon because the app wasn't very retentive in those days. There's some pretty basic ways to measure that people are coming back. The most obvious one that I hope most people know is that ...

我不记得产品是什么了。LivingSocial必须让整个公司与Groupon展开基本的竞争，因为当时的应用程序并不是很持久。有一些非常基本的方法来衡量人们回来了。最明显的是我希望大多数人都知道。。。

It's just new users so making sure that you're tracking whether a brand new user, someone who just signed up, what percentage of those users will come back like a week later or 30 days later.

这只是一个新用户，所以要确保你在跟踪一个新用户，一个刚刚注册的用户，其中有多大比例的用户会在一周后或者30天后回来。

It's really important to track a longer period of time because a week later is just not harsh enough metric and it's important to see how fast you'll end up losing users because you'll have to figure out a way to find the new ones and that becomes really, really hard at some point if the number of users you have becomes ... Starts to become quite high. The second one is just daily active users. There might be people that disagree with this.

追踪一个较长的时间是非常重要的，因为一个星期后还不够严格，而且很重要的是要看你最终失去用户的速度会有多快，因为你必须想办法找到新的用户，如果你的用户数量变得。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。如果 第二个只是日常的活跃用户。可能有些人不同意这一点。

I don't think there are too many but I now think that monthly active users has become like the new BS metric, that's like very similar to like, just like number of registered users, like number of registered user is like a very silly metric.

我不认为有太多，但我现在认为，每月活跃用户已经变得像新的BS指标，这是非常类似的喜欢，就像注册用户的数量一样，注册用户的数量是一个非常愚蠢的指标。

I remember seven or eight years ago, I think like ... I want to say was like Linkedin came out and said, "We have 200 million registered users." I was like, who cares how many people are using LinkedIn and I'm now starting to think that like MAU is becoming quite close to that now. Daily active users is really hard to maintain.

我记得七，八年前，我想就像。。。我想说的是，就像LinkedIn出来说的那样，“我们有2亿注册用户。” 我想，谁在乎有多少人在使用LinkedIn呢?我现在开始认为，就像Mau一样，现在正变得越来越接近LinkedIn了。每天活跃的用户真的很难维护。

I mean, how many products do you use every single day.

我是说，你每天用多少产品。

If you just look at your phone and you go through all of the possible apps, how many of those do you actually use every single day. I think it's a really harsh metric and we actually found at MixPanel ... So even if you're a B to B company and you might think, "Well, I don't know, I'm selling the businesses so like, can I really maintain like daily active users, especially on Saturday and Sunday，" and we actually found that there's like a really, really strong correlation with daily use and rate of churn, rate of people like no longer paying for the product.

如果你只看你的手机，你会浏览所有可能的应用程序，你每天实际使用的应用程序有多少。我认为这是一个非常苛刻的指标，我们在MixPanel上发现了。。。所以，即使你是B到B公司，你可能会认为，“嗯，我不知道，我出售的业务，我真的可以像日常活跃用户一样，特别是在周六和周日，我真的可以保持。”事实上，我们发现，这与日常使用和流失率有很强的相关性，人们不愿意为产品付费。

It didn't take very many users and it was like one point, four daily actives would like reduce churn to like a dollar churn to like to sub 10%, it's incredible.

它不需要太多的用户，它就像一个点，四个日常活动想减少搅动像一美元搅动喜欢低于10%，这是难以置信的。

I really stress measuring DAU and then the last thing is, a B to B slant again is something that I think a lot of B to B companies make an early mistake with.

我真的很强调测量DAU，最后一件事是，A B对B倾斜，我认为很多B对B的公司在早期犯了一个错误。

It's actually not just a B to B company.

事实上，这不仅仅是一个B对B的公司。

It's actually companies that do subscription so I don't know if there are companies that would ever think that they may offer a subscription of any sort, like if you're a meditation app or something like that.

事实上，是一些公司在进行订阅，所以我不知道是否有公司会认为他们可能会提供任何类型的订阅，比如如果你是一个冥想应用或类似的东西。

It's just dollar ...

只是美元。。。

It's monthly dollar churn so if you're charging your customers monthly, many businesses charge annually but usually most startups start with monthly because annual commitments sometimes can be hard for early adopters.

所以，如果你每月向你的客户收取费用，很多企业每年都要收取费用，但通常大多数初创公司都是从每月开始的，因为对早期的用户来说，年度承诺有时很难实现。

It's just measuring revenue churn.

它只是衡量收入的变化。

I want to give you a site story, if you have revenue churn and your revenue churn is say 7% per month, right, you might think, "Awesome, I'm keeping 93% of these dollars every single month. This is awesome, I'm doing really, really, really well." The problem is, it's a 7% monthly churn and if you extrapolate that out over 12 months, you're actually losing 58% of your revenue in a year.

我想给你一个网站的故事，如果你有收入流失，你的收入流失是每月7%，对吧，你可能会想，“太棒了，我每个月都有93%的收入。这太棒了，我做得真的，真的，真的很好。” 问题是，它是一个每月7%的流失，如果你推断超过12个月，你实际上是失去了58%的收入在一年。

It's really harsh. A lot of people like ... For some reason it's like, this thing is like not mathematically intuitive to most people.

真的很严酷。很多人喜欢。。。因为某种原因，这东西对大多数人来说并不是数学上的直觉。

I don't know why.

我不知道为什么。

It wasn't even mathematically intuitive to me early on and if you think about it, like you're spending all of this energy with marketing and improving the landing page and improving the getting starting flow. You're doing all of that and if you don't have retention, if you're losing that 7% every single month, you have to somehow make up for that 58% that you lost going into the new year.

在我看来，这在数学上还不是很直观，如果你考虑一下的话，就好像你把所有的精力都花在了市场营销上，改进了登陆页面，改进了启动流程一样。你做了所有这些，如果你没有保持，如果你每一个月失去7%，你必须在某种程度上弥补你在新的一年失去的58%。

If you start thinking about it like, "Wow, we're making a million dollars and we're losing $580,000 and we're starting the year like that，" you not only have to do that and grow on top of that. Once your base of revenue gets really high, it becomes really hard to keep up and you kind of have this like really long arc of like a shark fin effect basically.

如果你开始这样想，“哇，我们赚了一百万美元，损失了五十八万美元，今年就要开始了，”你不仅要做到这一点，还要在这一点上成长。一旦你的收入基础真的变得很高，它变得很难跟上，你有这样一种很长的弧形，就像一个鱼翅的效果。

It's really important to look at your monthly churn and this will be the single cause of like debt but the problem, it's like the worst kind of debt.

看看你每月的债务变动真的很重要，这将是造成类似债务的唯一原因，但问题是，它就像是最糟糕的一种债务。

It's like debt that occurs.

就像债务发生一样。

It's really like ...

就像。。。

It's really flat growth but it occurs like eventually in like four or five years, if you're able to acquire users.

这确实是一个缓慢的增长，但如果你能够获得用户，它最终会在四，五年内出现。

I mentioned this, not only because ...

我提到这个，不仅仅是因为。。。

I talked to some founders about this but this is also something that like really hurt us in the early stages of MixPanel and we really have to figure out a way to fix this and there's all kinds of ways you can use product, you can use pricing. There's all kinds of ways to experiment with this but this thing probably gave me the greatest number of nightmares and lack of sleep I think ever.

我和一些创始人谈过这一点，但这也是在MixPanel的早期阶段伤害我们的事情，我们真的必须想出一种方法来解决这个问题，还有各种各样的方法，你可以使用产品，你可以使用价格。有各种各样的实验方法，但这件事可能给我带来了最多的噩梦和睡眠不足，我认为有史以来。

I really want to stress that on all B to B companies here. Really, think through this number and think about like, almost graph like, "Okay, what would our rate of growth be if churn stayed constant?" It's really important. Cool.

我真的想在这里强调所有的B到B公司。真的，想一下这个数字，想一下，就像，几乎是图表，“好吧，如果我们的增长率保持不变会是多少?” 这真的很重要。很好。

I wanted to go over two things. One, I recognized that there are a lot of people here that have zero users so they're like, what the hell do I measure? What if I have less than 50 users? Well, the truth is I couldn't really think of a better idea than just basically, you just have to talk to your users.

我想复习两件事。第一，我认识到这里有很多人没有用户，所以他们就像，我该怎么衡量呢? 如果我有少于50个用户呢? 事实上，我真的想不出一个更好的主意，仅仅是简单的，你只需要和你的用户交谈。

I thought I'd give you a mini story about, at least at MixPanel what we did. When we had like no users and I have that page, that just said, metrics you'll drool over, one trick that I use is that I had like maybe 10 or 11 or 12 customers and honestly, I just put all of them on IM, like on G Chat or something.

我想我会给你一个小故事，至少在MixPanel我们做了什么。当我们没有用户的时候，我有一个页面，上面写的是，你会流口水的指标，我用的一个技巧是，我可能有10个，11个或12个客户，老实说，我把他们都放到了IM上，就像G聊天之类的。

I don't know what the kids use these days maybe like WhatsApp. I honestly just like would just badger them on like WhatsApp or G Chat or whatever and then just ask them.

我不知道这些天孩子们用的是什么。老实说，我只是喜欢像WhatsApp或G聊天之类的纠缠他们，然后再问他们。

I remember one time we were trying to redesign our funnel UI and we used to have a vertical funnel but we had a competitor that had a horizontal funnel and it seem like that was a better idea. It seem like that was more intuitive for customers.

我记得有一次，我们试图重新设计我们的漏斗UI，我们曾经有一个垂直漏斗，但我们有一个竞争对手，有一个水平漏斗，这似乎是一个更好的想法。看起来这对顾客来说更直观。

I didn't really know how to like get the data because like how was I really going to find out whether they liked one of those two UIs.

我真的不知道如何获取数据，因为就像我怎样才能真正了解他们是否喜欢这两个UI中的一个。

It was just me and a co-founder so how the heck were we going to like do an AB test on that feature? There was no realistic way to do that. All I did was I just made like a really crappy version of the UI that I thought would be better, the horizontal version of a funnel.

这只是我和一个联合创始人，所以我们到底会喜欢做一个AB测试的功能? 没有切实可行的方法来做到这一点。我所做的只是把UI做成一个非常糟糕的版本，我认为这样会更好，就是漏斗的水平版本。

It was kind of like gray scale.

有点像灰度。

I made like a really beautiful colorful version of like the vertical one which was kind of our control. Then, I just asked like 11 people which one is better? Then I want to impress this thing because Gustaf mentioned that it's the delta, it's the difference that matters in AB test, not that this is like a true perfect AB test but like, I asked 11 people on IM, got feedback in a day and 10 out of the 11 said, horizontal funnels and then we just made it and we built it and we never looked back and it was totally the right decision in retrospect. I don't think there's anyway that you can kind of skirt by, talking to customers but here's the benefit of talking to customer, even though it feel maybe as more tedious than looking at a graph. You're going to get way more information and depth from talking to customers than you ever will looking at a data point in a graph. No matter how much you slice and dice and segment the data, no matter how mathematical you are about it, you will never get as much information and in building your own intuition than just talking to customers and it's really critical that you do it. The one thing that I wish I had done back then was I wish I just wrote it down.

我做了一个真的很漂亮的彩色版本，像垂直的一样，这是我们的一种控制。然后，我就问了11个人哪一个更好? 然后我想给这件事留下深刻印象，因为古斯塔夫提到它是三角洲，它的区别在于AB测试，不是说这是一个真正完美的AB测试，而是说，我在IM上询问了11个人，一天之内得到了反馈，11个人中有10个说，水平漏斗，然后我们做了它，然后我们建立了它，我们从来没有回头看，这是一个完全正确的决定。我不认为有什么你可以回避的，与顾客交谈，但这是与顾客交谈的好处，即使它觉得比看一个图表更乏味。您将从与客户的交谈中获得比在图表中查看数据点更多的信息和深度。无论你对数据进行多大的切分，切分和分段，无论你对数据的数学化程度如何，你都永远不会得到比与客户交谈更多的信息，也不会建立起自己的直觉，而你这样做是非常关键的。我当时做的唯一一件事就是我希望我能把它写下来。

I wish I wrote down tons of the feedback because I think it would have helped ... My co-founder would have helped employees in the company down the road, really go on the journey. Make them feel like they went on the journey with me rather than having a role, kind of feeling that they were so split up. Then the last thing that I thought I would bring up is to impart what I kind of said at the beginning which is that, I think one of the biggest mistakes that people make with analytics is being really overcomplicated, thinking that they need to be supersophisticated, thinking that they need to track all kinds of crazy cohorts and they need to have like a dashboard with like 30 pains on it that all like loads, we have like mission control.

我希望我能写下大量的反馈，因为我认为这会有助于。。。我的联合创始人会帮助公司的员工走上成功之路，真正走上成功之路。让他们觉得他们是和我一起去旅行的，而不是扮演一个角色，感觉他们是如此的分离。然后，我想我要说的最后一件事就是告诉大家，我刚开始说过的话，我认为人们在分析中犯的一个最大的错误就是太过复杂，认为他们需要超级复杂，认为他们需要追踪各种疯狂的群体，他们需要像一个仪表板，上面有30个像负荷一样的痛苦，我们有像任务控制一样的控制。

I don't think that is necessary.

我不认为这是必要的。

I had that, it didn't work, it was really hard to run the company that way. What also happens is that when you build your team, it will be really ...

我有，不起作用，这是真的很难经营公司的方式。同样发生的是当你组建团队的时候，它会真的。。。

It will be confusing for your team, of those 30 pains like which one do I need to care about? I think that we need things that ... Humans just need to simplify things so I'd pick one north star metric. The north star metric I would choose in this case is like, what is a number that you're willing to bet the company on, right? If that number goes south, you deserve to die.

这会让你的团队感到困惑，在这30个痛苦中，我需要关心哪一个? 我认为我们需要的是。。。人类只需要简化一些事情，所以我会选择一个北极星指标。在这种情况下，我选择的北极星指标是，你愿意为公司打赌的数字是多少，对吗? 如果这个数字偏南，你应该去死。

If that number goes up, you will like ... You will have like made a huge dent in the universe. What is that metric? I'm not saying, you need to choose that metric forever but choose it for six months. Commit some time to it and if you find out that it's actually like the wrong metric which it will be probably the first time you chooses, usually your metrics are wrong. Then, you can change it but commit again for another six months but choose that one number and then like if what you have to do at the beginning is basically just like print it out and like put it all around the office, do it, because people will start to be maniacally focused on it, they'll show up to meetings and go, "Yeah, but that number is like down, what are we going to do?" Where you can get really complex is discovering why that number is down or why it's going up. That's when you can get really sophisticated. That's when you can slice and dice it and figure out what the retention is and things like and measure it over a funnel but keep things really simple. Then, the second thing is like, don't boil the ocean. Pick three or five other things, I think less is more and just stay there, telling even large companies ... Most large companies don't do this and it usually is very discombobulating for the work force.

如果这个数字上升，你会喜欢。。。你会喜欢在宇宙中留下巨大的印记。那是什么公制的? 我不是说，你需要永远选择这个指标，但要选择六个月。给它一些时间，如果你发现它实际上是一个错误的度量，它可能是你第一次选择，通常你的度量是错误的。然后，你可以改变它，但再次承诺六个月，但选择一个数字，然后就像如果你一开始要做的事情就像打印出来一样，就像把它放在办公室里一样，那么就去做吧，因为人们会开始疯狂地专注于这个数字，他们会出现在会议上，然后就走了:“是的，但是这个数字是一样的，我们要做什么呢?” 真正复杂的是发现这个数字为什么下降或者为什么上升。那时你就能变得非常成熟。这时，你就可以把它切成片，切成片，算出它的留存值是什么，什么东西是什么，然后在漏斗上测量它，但要保持简单。然后，第二件事是，不要把海洋煮沸。其他三五件事，我认为少是多，只是停留在那里，甚至告诉大公司。。。大多数大公司不这样做，它通常是非常混乱的劳动力。

It's totally fine to have numbers that you wish to monitor but don't focus on them. Awesome, I think that's it and then, for the people that were like slightly bored, because I went over the basics, I thought I would help you out by just kind of having some advanced topics for later that you can read about. Really these are things that like I found really useful. My favorite one is this one, the Next Feature Fallacy by Andrew Chen.

有你想要监视的数字，但不要把重点放在这些数字上，这是完全可以的。太棒了，我想就是这样，对那些有点无聊的人来说，因为我复习了基础知识，我想我会帮你解决一些问题，为以后你提供一些你可以阅读的高级主题。这些都是我觉得很有用的东西。我最喜欢的一个是这一个，安德鲁陈的下一个特点谬论。

It's just this idea that we always think that like, the next thing that we make will be the thing that will change the trajectory of the company, i.e. Like the next feature is right around the corner and we're going to be huge and I would really recommend that you read that article.

这只是一个想法，我们总是认为，我们所做的下一件事将改变公司的发展轨迹，即，就像下一个功能就在眼前，我们将变得庞大，我真的建议你读那篇文章。

It's really awesome. One of my favorite one so for advanced stuff, these are just people worth following, reading about and can give you more ideas than what I've given you today. Awesome. Thank you. Jeff, Q and A. Okay. Cool. All right.

真的很棒。我最喜欢的一个，所以对于高级的东西，这些人只是值得追随，阅读，并可以给你比我今天给你的更多的想法。好极了。谢谢你。杰夫，Q和A好的。很好。那好吧。

Geoff Ralston: You want me to pick? Do you want me to pick?

你想让我挑? 要我挑吗?

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, I want to be fair.

是的，我想公平一点。

I don't be like, if like every speaker chose someone in the front.

我不是说，如果每个演讲者都选在前面的话。

Female: What would you suggest the conversion, some people conversion or trying conversion from visitors to register, considers registering versus subscribers, obtaining subscribers.

女性:你会建议什么转换，一些人转换或尝试转换从访客注册，考虑注册与用户，获得用户。

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, the problem with that is that, it's so ... Yeah, yes, I think someone asks, what are like good benchmarks for ... Given those five steps, visiting, signing up, using the product, what would be good conversion rates for anyone of those steps. The chart part with benchmarks like that, is that it's so dependent on the business in B to B, like going from like a visit to a sign up, I think like a four to 5% conversion rate is pretty good.

是的，问题是，它是如此。。。是的，我想有人会问，考虑到这五个步骤，访问，注册，使用产品，对这些步骤中的任何一个来说，什么是好的基准。图表部分是这样的基准，它是如此依赖于B到B的业务，就像从一个访问到一个签约，我认为4%到5%的转换率是相当好的。

I think I like swap notes with Stewart at Slack because we kind of had similar landing pages.

我想我喜欢和Stewart在Slack交换笔记，因为我们有类似的登陆页。

I think I ask them, what was your conversion rate at Slack and I think we both ended up being somewhere around like four to 5% from visit to sign up. That's said, like, I don't know what that would be for something like Airbnb where it's like getting to a landing page and then searching for your first place that you'd want to book.

我想我问他们，你的转换率是多少，我想我们最终都是在某个地方，大概4%到5%，从访问到注册。也就是说，我不知道这对Airbnb之类的东西是什么意思，因为它就像到达一个登陆页面，然后搜索你想要预订的第一个位置。

I think it's really dependent.

我觉得这是真的依赖。

I know that MixPanel publish on its blog, publishes lots of benchmarks.

我知道MixPanel在它的博客上发布，发布了很多基准测试。

I know the marketing team there that does that and they like publish all kinds of benchmarks for like, what should your retention be if you're a gaming company, if you're an E-commerce company, if you're a B to B company, things like that, social company, a video company, things like that.

我知道那里的营销团队就是这样做的，他们喜欢发布各种各样的基准，比如，如果你是一家游戏公司，如果你是一家电子商务公司，如果你是B对B公司，社交公司，视频公司之类的公司，那么你的留存率应该是多少呢?

I think that you could probably go there and find various benchmarks reports but it's really dependent on the business, yeah.

我想你可能会去那里，找到各种各样的基准报告，但它真的依赖于业务，是的。

Male: When you go into the sign up process, how do you see numbers vary, if you're like created an account name, and password, doing all that kind of sign up versus a single like log in with Google or LinkedIn, yeah, how does that transfer, do more people sign up if they have that like single click option, do you see more people drop off because they have to use one of those?

男性:当你进入注册过程时，你如何看待数字的变化，如果你喜欢创建一个帐户名和密码，在谷歌或LinkedIn上进行类似的注册，是的，如果他们有像点击一样的选项，你会看到更多的人注册，因为他们必须使用其中一个，你会看到更多的人注册吗?

Suhail Doshi: I think the question is what converts better like those social buttons where you can just like quickly authenticate like Facebook Connect versus just like standard sign up, is that right? Yeah, all of these questions, they require like a lot of specificity because it's actually like really unclear.

我想问题是，哪些东西可以像社交按钮那样更好地转换，你可以像Facebook Connect一样快速认证，而不是像标准注册一样，对吗? 是的，所有这些问题，它们都需要很多的特殊性，因为它实际上就像真的不清楚。

In that case, I actually don't know.

那样的话，我真的不知道。

I truly don't know and so I think the way to answer this question is to find friends in tangential industries that like don't compete with you but basically do that and then just be like, "Hey, what is your conversion rate? Have you tried something?" I don't actually think a lot of those numbers are secrets in reality.

我真的不知道，所以我想要回答这个问题的方法是在那些不喜欢和你竞争的行业找到朋友，然后就会说，“嘿，你的转化率是多少?你试过什么吗?” 我并不认为这些数字在现实中是秘密。

I mean, you can't go to your competitor and ask that but most of these things are not like super duper secret type stuff and like they could either give you the information and save you the six months or they'll just like say ... Or you try it out but it's sort of strange to keep it a secret so I'd rather give you ways that you can discover that.

我的意思是，你不能去问你的竞争对手，但这些事情中的大多数并不像超级秘密类型的东西，他们要么会给你信息，拯救你6个月，或者他们会说。。。或者你试着去做，但保守秘密有点奇怪，所以我宁愿给你一些方法，让你发现。

I would just ask friends that have a start up or even if they work at a big company, sometimes they're willing to share it. Yup. Cool.

我只会问那些刚起步的朋友，或者即使他们在大公司工作，有时他们也愿意分享。是啊。很好。

Male: You talked about making it easy for user, start using your product and then there's a slide there [inaudible] . How do you balance simplicity with informing your visitor, like what it is you do, why they should use your product? You don't have that brand recognition already where the visitor already had-

男:你说过要让用户变得容易，开始使用你的产品，然后有一个幻灯片[听不到]。你如何平衡简单性和告知访问者，比如你是做什么的，为什么他们应该使用你的产品? 你不是已经有了访客已经有的品牌识别-

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, right.

是的，对。

Male: How do you balance those two?

男:你怎么平衡这两个?

Suhail Doshi: Right, yeah. The question is, Airbnb's landing page was super simple and how do you balance like, I mean what if a lot of people just know about Airbnb and they just know what to use Airbnb for and then that's why they can keep it kind of simple versus like having something more complex. A good example of this is like Craigslist, it's crazy.

对，是的。问题是，airbnb的登陆页面非常简单，如果很多人只知道airbnb，他们只知道如何使用airbnb，那么这就是为什么他们可以保持它简单，而不是拥有更复杂的东西。这方面的一个很好的例子就是Craigslist，它太疯狂了。

If you go to their front page of Craigslist, it's like absolutely nuts. Even Amazon, if you go to Amazon.com, right? Even though Amazon has like huge brand recognition, you go to Amazon.com.

如果你去他们的首页Craigslist，那简直是疯了。即使是亚马逊，如果你去亚马逊网站，对吗? 即使亚马逊拥有巨大的品牌知名度，你也可以去亚马逊网站。

It's like, "Whoa，" there's like million things going on at once, right? How have these companies found the balance, how have they found how to deal with this complexity and the truth is, is that, I find that it's important to have like a guiding principle. What is it that you're trying to actually optimize for, right? In the case of YouTube, let's take YouTube as a good example, right? YouTube could just like be Google, and just like, what do you look, what do you want to watch? They could do that but they don't.

就像，“哇”，就像是同时发生了上百万件事，对吧? 这些公司是如何找到平衡的，他们是如何找到应对这种复杂性的方法的，事实是，我发现有一个指导原则是很重要的。你到底想优化什么，对吧? 以YouTube为例，让我们以YouTube为例，对吧? YouTube可能就像是谷歌，就像是，你看什么，你想看什么? 他们可以这样做，但他们没有。

I think the question really is, is like what is the team at YouTube trying to optimize for? Are they just trying to get you to like watch a video? Is Airbnb just trying to get you to search for any kind of hotel, or not hotel but Airbnb? I think like the team has to develop first a hypothesis of like what matter ... What do we think matters and then from there, it's important to experiment and try to figure that out.

我认为真正的问题是，就像YouTube的团队试图优化什么? 他们只是想让你喜欢看录像吗? Airbnb是想让您搜索任何类型的酒店，还是不是酒店，而是Airbnb? 我认为团队首先要建立一个假设，假设什么是重要的……我们认为什么是重要的，然后从这个假设出发，重要的是进行实验，并试图解决这个问题。

It turns out like it's not too ... Again, it's about the delta of like what people will actually gravitate more towards. If you make a really simple experience but like people are like really confused, because they don't even bother to do it or you ask them, then you kind of have like new information and I think the key is to find the minimum number of things you need to add to get someone started.

事实证明，这并不太。。。再一次，这是关于“喜欢”的三角洲，人们实际上会更倾向于什么。如果你做了一个很简单的体验，但就像人们很困惑一样，因为他们甚至懒得去做，或者你问他们，那么你就有点喜欢新的信息，我认为关键是找到最小数量的东西，你需要添加，以使某人开始。

I don't think there's anything ...

我不认为有什么。。。

I'm sure Amazon has tested that front page, like crazy and they found that it's like quite optimal. Yeah.

我相信亚马逊已经测试过了，就像疯了一样，他们发现这是最优的。是啊。

Male: In your personal experience, do you think that short term videos that's more than two minutes [inaudible] .

男性:在你的个人经历中，你认为短期视频超过两分钟(听不到)吗?

Suhail Doshi: They can.

他们可以。

It depends on the product.

这取决于产品。

I'll give you an example in MixPanel's case. Sorry. Yeah. The question was are video ... Are one to two minute video tutorials effective, fair? Yeah, so I think that it's complex. We did a video tutorial video in our flow, for example and like, I would say that, a lot of people didn't watch it, truthfully and this is what I mean by experimentation. A lot of people didn't watch that video tutorial.

在MixPanel的案例中，我将给出一个例子。对不起。是啊。问题是视频。。。一到两分钟的视频教程有效吗，公平吗? 是的，所以我认为这很复杂。我们做了一个视频教程视频在我们的流程，例如，我想说，很多人没有看它，老实说，这就是我所说的实验。很多人没有看那个视频教程。

I mean, I actually I think eliminated it in the first three steps but what we did find was this interesting thing that occurred, as a result of looking and measuring things which was that, we have a feature in MixPanel where you can like see every action that a user takes.

我的意思是，实际上我认为在前三个步骤中消除了它，但是我们确实发现了这个有趣的事情，这是因为我们在MixPanel中有一个特性，你可以看到用户所做的每一个动作。

I would literally just like go to every user and then just like watch like a creepy person just like sort of watching like everything that like someone would do in the product. Eventually when you do that like ... When you do hundreds of those and you just watched hundreds of those, you start to develop some sense of like, okay, what you developed is an idea, a hypothesis and all of these things require art and science and I think the companies that take it too far, they like take it too far to science, end up getting it wrong, they end up optimizing for like weird things. You can always make a button more yellow and bigger. That doesn't make users happy eventually. Anyway, to answer your question, what I found was that lots of people were just clicking randomly on like all the side menu options and my hypothesis was, well, they hadn't integrated MixPanel yet so there's nothing to look at so what the heck were you doing just like clicking on like funnels and retention, why would you do that? My hypothesis was, they were just curious like what the product did, what is it that they did and so we did this AB test, where we like had a control with like nothing, just the regular clicking around, seeing like some image and then we had another one that had like videos. Then we tried to see what cause people to like do their integration, their first integration, what was the conversion rate and turned out like the video, like super won. Actually we did even a more simple test than that.

我真的喜欢去每个用户，然后就像一个令人毛骨悚然的人一样看，就像每一件事，就像有人会在产品中做的一样。最终，当你这样做的时候，就像。。。当你这样做的时候，当你看着几百个的时候，你就会开始产生某种感觉，好吧，你提出的是一个想法，一个假设，所有这些东西都需要艺术和科学，我认为那些公司太过了，他们喜欢把它太过了科学，最终搞错了，他们最终会把它优化成奇怪的东西。你总能让一个按钮变得更黄，更大。这最终并不能让用户满意。不管怎样，要回答你的问题，我发现很多人只是随机点击，就像所有的边菜单选项，我的假设是，嗯，他们还没有集成MixPanel，所以没有什么可看的，所以你到底在做什么，就像点击漏斗和保持，你为什么要这么做呢? 我的假设是，他们很好奇，就像产品做了什么，他们做了什么，所以我们做了一个AB测试，在那里我们喜欢一个控件，没有什么，只是经常点击，看一些图片，然后我们有另一个，有喜欢的视频。然后我们试着看看是什么导致人们喜欢做他们的整合，他们的第一次整合，转换率是多少，结果就像视频一样，就像超级韩元一样。实际上，我们做了比这更简单的测试。

I think we just emailed people a video and said, "Watch this video, super basic，" I didn't even bother to implement it on the website and I had an amazing conversion rate. Then, we decided to add videos all ... To all of those tabs where they wouldn't have been anything anyway. That's why I want to say like, I want to stress this, it really depends and what matters is that you run the experiment to develop a hypothesis, i.e. The art not the science and then measure it, which is the science to find out whether the thing that you thought of was in fact right. Yeah.

我想我们刚给人们发了一个视频，说:“看这个视频，超级基本，”我甚至没有费心在网站上实现它，我有一个惊人的转化率。然后，我们决定添加所有的视频。。。到所有这些标签，反正他们不会是任何东西。这就是为什么我想说，我想强调这一点，它真的取决于，重要的是，你运行实验来发展一个假设，即艺术而不是科学，然后衡量它，这是一种科学，以找出你认为的事情是否真的是正确的。是啊。

Geoff Ralston: All the way to the back.

一直走到后面。

Male: I have a question for you, it's the churn, the revenue churn. How does that relate to [inaudible]

男:我有一个问题要问你，这是一个不稳定的问题，一个收入不稳定的问题。那与[听不见的]有什么关系?

Suhail Doshi: Fifty eight percent loss in revenue, over a year. Yup.

苏海尔多什:一年多来，收入损失了58%。是啊。

Male: You confirmed that we look at ... Where we look at retention [inaudible] .

男性:你证实了我们在看。。。。。。。我们在看留存[听不见的]。

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so there's slightly two different things. One is like user retention and then one is like dollar churn like.

是的，所以有两种不同的东西。一个就像用户留存，然后一个就像美元搅动一样。

In the case of dollar churn, the reason why I bring up dollar churn is that, even ... Like you could totally have a company where nobody uses the product and the company continues to keep paying for it, right? What I find that like most companies are like pretty incentivized to cut their spending and employees are incentivized because they lose it in their budget. With respect to dollar churn, you could have lot ...

对于美元的流失，我提出美元的流失的原因是，即使……你完全可以有一个公司，没有人使用产品，公司继续支付它，对吗? 我发现，就像大多数公司一样，它们会受到相当大的激励来削减支出，而员工也会受到激励，因为他们会在预算中失去支出。关于摇钱树，你可以有很多。。。

In a B to B company for example, you can have even one user using the product but the company could continue to spend money on it and like, you might see like a 40% retention rate.

例如，在B对B的公司，你甚至可以有一个用户使用产品，但公司可以继续在它上花钱，就像，你可能会看到一个40%的留存率。

It might be okay, as long as the company is continuing to spend but losing 40% of your dollars in a year is really hard and not good, retention. Does that make sense? Those things are not exactly linked. They're not directly linked. Yeah. Yeah, to give you kind of a benchmark like a chat app that's like often used a lot will have like 60, 70% retention. Those are some of the most retentive things. Something like Slack would probably have like 80% retention.

这可能是好的，只要公司继续支出，但损失40%的美元在一年是真的很难的，不是很好的，留存。这说得通吗? 那些东西并没有完全联系在一起。它们没有直接联系。是啊。是的，给你一个像聊天应用一样的基准测试，就像经常用到的一样，会有60%，70%的留存率。这是一些最值得留存的东西。像slack这样的东西可能有80%的留存率。

It's kind of like unbelievable. Whereas like our product, like MixPanel, when we first started out like the first year, I think we had like 30, 40% retention and that's not that great, these are our first few years. Yeah.

有点难以置信。而像我们的产品，像MixPanel，当我们第一次开始像第一年，我认为我们有30%，40%的留存，这不是很好，这是我们的头几年。是啊。

Male: Are these whole metrics, I think you have all four, is that hardware startups, is the same like you build that we need to go for it?

男性:这些指标都是完整的吗?我想你有四个指标，那是硬件初创公司吗?就像你构建的，我们需要去做的一样吗?

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, the question is, are these metrics, can they be used for hardware startup. Yeah, I don't see any reason why. We worked with Jawbone for a long time and we work with Fitbit. Most hardware ... Does your hardware company have a software component to it?

是的，问题是，这些指标是否可以用于硬件启动? 是的，我不认为有什么理由。我们和Jawbone一起工作了很长时间，和Fitbit一起工作。大多数硬件。。。你的硬件公司有软件组件吗?

Male: Actually, we do subscription model like [inaudible] .

男性:事实上，我们做的订阅模式，就像[听不见的]。

Suhail Doshi: Okay, so it's a hardware company with subscription model. Yeah, absolutely.

苏海尔多什:好吧，那么它是一家有预订模式的硬件公司。是的，当然。

It maybe more challenging as a hardware company to track but it's like, sometimes but it's totally doable. Most hardware is like connected to the internet somehow so I don't see any reason why, like a lot of the scooter companies for example, they're like all connected to hardware and they have a software component. There's really no difference. Yeah.

作为一个硬件公司，追踪可能更具挑战性，但有时却是完全可行的。大多数硬件都像连接到Internet一样，所以我不认为有任何理由，例如，像许多滑板车公司一样，它们像所有连接到硬件一样，并且它们有一个软件组件。真的没什么区别。是啊。

Male: [inaudible] .

男:[听不见]。

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so the question is, the first page was trying to target like various kinds of sizes of companies and then like the second landing of MixPanel like in 2012 basically didn't kind of dispose of that and had something very different, it was marketing features and stuff and how do you figure out like what to do basically from that point to the next point. Yeah, so I think the basic gist is that ... So you can clearly see like I had no idea who our customers were and then after like a few years, you talk to users, you ask them like what size of company they are, if they sign up, if you want to, we didn't do that but we just spent a lot of time ...

是的，所以问题是，第一页是试图瞄准各种规模的公司，然后像MixPanel在2012年的第二次登陆一样，基本上没有处理这个问题，并且有一些非常不同的东西，这是市场特性和东西，你如何想出从这个点到下一个点做些什么。是的，所以我认为最基本的要点是。。。所以你可以清楚地看到，我不知道我们的客户是谁，几年后，你和用户聊天，问他们公司有多大规模，如果他们注册，如果你想，我们没有这样做，但我们只是花了很多时间。。。

It was so obvious that like everyone that was signing up for MixPanel at that time was a startup.

很明显，就像当时所有注册MixPanel的人一样，这是一个初创公司。

In our case, it would be, we call that a small business.

在我们的情况下，我们称它为小企业。

Male: [inaudible]

男:[听不见]

Suhail Doshi: I think it took like maybe no longer than six months to figure out that we were not going to sign up a large company. Yeah. We just didn't have the product, it just wasn't there, we hadn't worked on it long enough so the only people that were willing to basically try were companies that could take the risk to try it and most of these companies didn't have anything anyway so it was even easier.

我想大概花了不到六个月的时间，我们才明白，我们不会签下一个大公司。是啊。我们只是没有产品，没有产品，我们还没做够长时间，所以唯一愿意尝试的人是那些冒着风险去尝试它的公司，而且这些公司中的大多数都没有任何东西，所以它更简单。

It's easier to target companies that had nothing and had ... Were willing to bear risk and then most of the time, I would always employ this trick where I would just ...

更容易瞄准那些一无所有，有。。。愿意承担风险的公司，然后大多数时候，我总是用这种把戏，我只是。。。

I would charge the money for it and then if they said no, I would just give it to them for free because the feedback was more important.

我会为它收费，然后如果他们说不，我会把它免费给他们，因为反馈是更重要的。

I always wanted to see if they would pay for it and so the only people that are willing to do that are also small businesses, it turns out. For us it was just like ...

我一直想知道他们是否愿意为此买单，所以唯一愿意这样做的人也是小企业，结果是这样的。对我们来说就像。。。

It kind of hit us, it slapped us in the face, it wasn't like this hard thing to figure out. Yeah.

它击中了我们，打了我们的脸，这不像是一件很难搞清楚的事情。是啊。

Male: [inaudible] .

男:[听不见]。

Suhail Doshi: Yeah, so to be clear, we weren't necessarily building things to bring new users on. Sorry, the question is you guys built, forgot about ... You decided to not build forgot about password, how do you know when to build quality of life features versus features that just acquire new users? Yeah, so I think that we didn't ...

苏黑尔·多希:是的，所以要说清楚，我们并不一定要建造一些东西来吸引新的用户。对不起，问题是你们建立了，忘记了。。。你决定不建立忘记密码，你怎么知道什么时候建立生活质量的功能，而不是仅仅获得新用户的功能? 是的，所以我想我们没有。。。

It wasn't so much that only built features to acquire new users. We built features to acquire new users and to keep existing users. We were very focused on like parts of the product that would actually make a difference, right, that would be clearly differentiating compared to all of the other possible options out there. One of the things that's like not different is whether you have forgot about password, right? That was like in the bucket things that like maybe don't matter.

这并不是说仅仅是为了获取新用户而构建的功能。我们构建了获取新用户和保持现有用户的功能。我们非常专注于产品的某些部分，这些部分实际上会产生不同的效果，对吧，与其他所有可能的选择相比，它们会有明显的区别。有一件事好像没什么不同，那就是你是否忘了密码，对吗? 就像是在水桶里的东西，也许并不重要。

I think the question is really like, when does it become a problem enough for you that it's worth building, right? If you're finding that like it turns out that the number of request that you're getting for forgot about password is like increasing and then manually doing this process, it's like annoying. Then, you should just build that feature because you know that if you don't build a feature, they can't log in then you can't retain them and then you lose them.

我想这个问题是真的，什么时候它对你来说足够成为一个值得建立的问题，对吗? 如果您发现这样的情况，就像是因为忘记密码而收到的请求数量会增加，然后手动执行这个过程，那么这就像是很烦人的事情。然后，您应该构建该功能，因为您知道如果不构建一个功能，它们就不能登录，那么您就不能留存它们，然后丢失它们。

It becomes this flywheel effect where like the only way to retain them is to do that.

它变成了飞轮效果，就像唯一能留住它们的方法就是这样做。

In fact, even though MixPanel didn't build forgot about password, for like maybe 12 to 18 months, we went eventually ... We found that people would try like multiple times, when I was looking at that stream of every action that a user would take, I found that like people were like going to the log in screen like five times.

事实上，即使MixPanel并没有忘记密码，大概12到18个月，我们最终还是去了。。。我们发现人们会尝试多次，当我看着用户将采取的每一个行动的流时，我发现就像人们要去登录屏幕5次一样。

I was just so confused.

我只是太困惑了。

I was like, "Why are they going to the log in screen five times?" I was like, "I think it's because they can't log in." Some people don't even hit forgot about password, they just like try, try, try.

我说，“他们为什么要五次登录屏幕呢?” 我说，“我想是因为他们不能登录。” 有些人甚至没有点击忘记密码，他们只是喜欢尝试，尝试，尝试。

I'm sure you've all done this like with a bank or something, you're like, "I'll just do it tomorrow，" you don't even bother.

我相信你们都做过类似于银行之类的事情，你就像是，“我明天再做”，你甚至都不用费心了。

It turns out that even that happens and so we went so far, even though we didn't do that, I like to think that like we really made up for this later on. We went to ... So far, we found this clever trick that Facebook use which was that, when you failed to log in to MixPanel like three times, on your third time, we just send you an email that says, "We just sent you an email. Just go to your email and click the button and you'll log in right now. Don't worry about forgetting it, don't worry about changing your password, just log in." It turned out that like that had this great retentive effect because we were really focused on retention at that time. Yeah.

事实证明，即便如此，我们还是走了很远，即使我们没有做到，我喜欢这样想，就像我们以后真的弥补了这一点。我们去了。。。到目前为止，我们发现Facebook使用了一个聪明的伎俩，那就是，当你第三次登录到MixPanel失败了，我们就给你发了一封邮件，说:“我们刚给你发了一封邮件。只要转到你的邮件，点击这个按钮，你现在就可以登录。别担心忘记了，不要担心更改你的密码，只要登录就好了。” 事实证明，像这样的留存效果很好，因为我们当时真的很专注于留存。是啊。

Geoff Ralston: Okay, a couple more questions, over here.

好的，还有几个问题，在这里。

Male: [inaudible]

男:[听不见]

Suhail Doshi: Yeah. How do you gauge product market fit? How do you measure product market fit? I think there's a lot of people that probably have already ... Will talk about or have already talked about like people ... And I think they're all right so I'll give you a quantitative slant versus like a qualitative slant. Some qualitative slants were things like when people are willing to spread you to their friends, that kind of thing. The quantitative version of this is really just measuring your retention, like how many people ...

是的。你如何衡量产品市场适合度? 你如何衡量产品市场适合度? 我想有很多人可能已经。。。会像人一样谈论或者已经谈论过了。。。我认为他们是对的，所以我会给你们一个数量上的倾斜和质量上的倾斜的对比。一些质量上的偏差就像是当人们愿意把你传播给他们的朋友那样的事情。定量的说法其实只是衡量你的记忆力，比如有多少人。。。

It's really measuring like DAU, it's really measuring the percentage of people that come back a week later, 30 days later.

它真的像Dau一样测量，它测量的是一周后，30天后再回来的人的百分比。

It's a number of people that like become almost they need your product or they feel like life will be a lot worse.

很多人喜欢变得几乎需要你的产品，或者他们觉得生活会变得更糟。

I think that you can totally measure that by how they use it and so I think the quantitative measurement is basically finding like some benchmark, some cents for your industry, maybe that's like 30% and just remember like that benchmark is probably like average and your desires is to basically be above average.

我认为，你完全可以通过他们如何使用它来衡量，所以我认为，定量的测量基本上是找到一些基准，一些美分，对你的行业来说，也许这是30%，只是记住，就像这个基准可能是平均值，你的愿望是基本上高于平均值。

If you can like significantly beat that benchmark, then I think that you've like really ... You've done better than probably product market fit.

如果你能显著超过这个基准，那么我认为你真的喜欢。。。你已经做得比产品市场更好。

I think that's one thing.

我想这是一回事。

I think another thing is like, you can try to measure like overall like, repetitive use, like frequent use in a day. You can make pretty harsh metrics. You can be like, for example with DAU, you could say, "I don't want it to just be daily active user like they did one thing.

我认为另一种情况是，你可以尝试像总体测量一样，重复使用，就像在一天中频繁使用。你可以制定出非常苛刻的标准。你可以像Dau一样，你可以说，“我不希望它像他们做的一样成为日常的活跃用户。”

I want it to be ... That user has to have watched five videos and then and only then do they count as a daily active user，" so you can be particularly harsh about that metric, right? Someone coming and like ... That's why I say MAU is kind of a BS metric now because you come and watch one video and then never come back again and you like count and that's not like a very healthy business so I think that find ways to be harsh about your north star and I think that you'll find that you reach product market fit, yeah. Yeah, I think with MixPanel it was like, 30, 40% retention, it was like really horrendous and we totally didn't have product market fit yet. Yeah.

我希望它是。。。那个用户必须看过五个视频，然后，直到那时，他们才算一个每天都在使用的用户，“所以你可以对这个指标特别苛刻，对吧? 有人来了，喜欢。。。这就是为什么我说MAU现在是一种BS标准，因为你来看一个视频，然后再也不回来了，你喜欢计数，这不是一个非常健康的业务，所以我认为找到方法来严厉对待你的北极星，我认为你会发现，你达到产品市场适合，是的。是的，我想对于MixPanel来说，这是30%，40%的留存，这是真的可怕的，我们完全还没有产品市场适合。是啊。

Geoff Ralston: Okay. Last question.

好的。最后一个问题。

Male: What is one piece of conventional startup wisdom that you think is usually wrong?

男性:你认为一种传统的创业智慧通常是错的吗?

Suhail Doshi: It's like a Peter Thiel question, what's one piece of conventional wisdom that you think is generally wrong?

苏黑尔·多希:这就像一个彼得·提尔的问题，你认为一个普遍错误的传统智慧是什么?

Male: About startups.

关于初创公司。

Suhail Doshi: About startups in general.

SuhailDoshi:关于一般的初创公司。

Geoff Ralston: It's a hard last question.

这是一个很难回答的最后一个问题。

Suhail Doshi: It's a hard last question.

这是一个很难回答的最后一个问题。

It's like everything else is fine.

好像一切都很好。

I think ...

我想。。。

I don't know, I need to think about it but I think that one thing that has like become pretty clear to me is that I think after having done MixPanel for about a decade, I kind of figured out that ...

我不知道，我需要考虑一下，但是我想有一件事对我来说已经变得很清楚了，那就是我想在做了大约十年的MixPanel之后，我算出了。。。

I tried to impart it on you in the talk today, which is just that, it's much better to just like ...

我在今天的演讲中试着把它传授给你，就是这样，就像。。。

I think that we tend to complicate things as humans and that comes through in like everything. For example like we tend to make a version one of a product and then we get to version two and we're like, "Okay, we're done." We're like, we did it, we solve the problem and then often a found were like, kind of get distracted and then go and like work on the next product, the next thing and they haven't yet figured out like their retention is probably not great or they're operating at negative margins or like all these things. That same thing even happens with numbers like we pick our three metrics and then we continue to get more complex as a business and then we add the next 20 things and we do all these things to like ...

我认为，作为人类，我们往往会使事情变得复杂，而这种复杂就像所有的事情一样。例如，我们倾向于做一个产品的第一个版本，然后再到第二个版本，我们就会说，“好了，我们完成了。” 我们就像是，我们做到了，我们解决了问题，然后常常发现，就像，有点分心，然后去，喜欢下一个产品的工作，下一件事情，他们还没有发现，就像他们的留存可能不是很好，或者他们正在以负利润率或所有这些事情。同样的事情甚至发生在数字上，比如我们选择了三个指标，然后我们继续变得更加复杂，作为一个企业，然后我们添加了接下来的20件事情，我们做了所有这些事情来喜欢。。。

In hopes of like, feeling like we control the situation better and I just think that those are all distractions and mistakes and I think it's really hard for the average founder to actually just be focused on something boring. We tend to have like 80 or something and like we just decide to get very easily distracted and I think it's hard to do something ... Do the same thing for four or five years, because we don't like feel challenged anymore and I think that's a huge mistake that founders often make and I don't know that anyone say, "Oh that's like totally wrong Suhail." For whatever reason like every founder repeats it. There must be something, I don't know ... There must be some kind of wisdom that we all think this is the right thing and I made those mistakes.

希望，感觉我们能更好地控制局面，我只是认为这些都是分心和错误，我认为这真的很难让普通的创始人实际上只是专注于一些无聊的事情。我们倾向于80岁左右，就像我们决定很容易分心，我认为很难做些什么。。。做同样的事4到5年，因为我们不喜欢再感到受到挑战，我认为这是创始人经常犯的一个大错误，我不知道有人会说，“哦，那就像是完全错误的苏海尔。”。不管是什么原因，就像每个创始人都会重复的那样。一定有什么，我不知道。。。一定有某种智慧，我们都认为这是正确的事情，我犯了那些错误。

I made new products that I shouldn't have.

我做了我不该做的新产品。

I've measured too many things, over-optimized things that didn't need to be optimized so yeah, that's it. Cool. Thanks.
