- - So, Patrick, welcome.

 So Patrick is the co founder and CEO of Stripe.

 He launched the startup or now pretty big company in 2010 correct? With his brother John.

 - Well actually we started working on it full time in 2010 but it actually, to your comment just there about companies launching, it took us quite awhile to launch 'cause we had to get all these banking partnerships in place and so on and so we didn't launch until September 2011.

 And we'd been working - Oh.

 - on it for almost two years at that point and every time we saw PG or really anyone else from YC all they would ask us is why we had not launched yet.

 So some things don't change.

 - That's interesting.

 So two years until you had to-- - Yeah it was I think, - practice.

 - one year and 11 months from sort of first line up code to public launch.

 Which to be clear I don't recommend.

 That is not a good idea.

 Just we had to because we had to kind of get all these other things in place and because it sort of too us so long to have publicly launched, versus, we tried to be very disciplined about sort of gradually expanding the number of users every month and so even though we weren't publicly available, we got our first user, like first production user just kind of freelancing and then every month we tried to add at least kind of a handful of users and so by then we publicly launched and we did have about 100 users which I mean back then to us seems, that's a big deal.

 That's very large.

 - Speaking of, actually when I was preparing for this interview I was trying to jog my memories and I remember specifically because your office was near here in Palo Alto and I remember back then people would always talk about the Collison brothers running around going to peoples offices and like installing their API into the web apps and in true do things don't scale a fashion.

 And I assume you were not only trying to make sure they installed it but also get user feedback.

 And it happens so much that actually, I don't know if you know Paul Graham, PG, now calls it the Collison Installation.

 And this is actually something we give, we tell our founders to go do this.

 Do the Collison Installation 'cause obviously, in the hindsight it seems so obvious to do.

 - Well it sort of serves two purposes.

 One is your point.

 It serves as a really good way to kinda get, to use research and to get kind of UX feedback and so on and I mean if you've done this I'm sure you had the experience where, you design what you're absolutely certain is the most streamlined user friendly straight forward frictionless way to do whatever it is the product does and then you kind of, you plant it and kind of put in front of a user and you just kind of ask them to do whatever it is and they find it completely impenetrable and like they're clicking all the wrong links and they can't find the net button even though the next button is there blinking in green and such.

 And so it's invariably sort of incredibly painful.

 There's sort of nothing so sobering as watching somebody use kind of the first version of some new product.

 But the other reason for us was, we had suggested to somebody they use Stripe of they switch to Stripe whatever and invariably their response is oh yeah, sure that sounds awesome but it can be, they'll postpone it, they'll postpone it again.

 Just like there's never a moment where it's like okay this is the evening where I'm going to switch to Stripe.

 And so us going and sort of accosting them in person sort of helped, he'll talk in sales it's always like a why you and a why this and why now? And these kind of questions.

 And going in person kind of created a why now moment.

 It's like well we're here at your house.

 - Did you just show up or how did you? Like what-- - I don't think we ever actually just showed up.

 Although, perhaps we should've but no.

 We tried to be kind of at least semi invited.

 - Got it.

 So Stripe now today, I mean you've come a long way since back then.

 I mean it's not even been, it's probably been a decade.

 Not even.

 But I mean today you're, well you have 1300 employees across nine offices across the world.

 You're doing, I have a list here.

 You manage 200 million API requests a day.

 You process billions a year for millions of companies across 130 companies.

 Your latest round of fundings, Stripe is now worth 20 million dollars.

 Billion Anyway the list keeps going on but I'm not gonna, I'll stop there otherwise people are gonna think I'm your PR agent.

 But anyway, you've clearly done something right.

 And so I want to spend a lot of, I guess the time today talking about running your startup from the perspective of the startup CEO, you yourself.

 And it's kind of like zoom.

 Like what do you think about from zooming in on the day to day operations to zooming out to long term strategic decisions? So maybe to help us ease into the discussion, one thing is when you start off, when from the very beginning a lot of friends get together and they come up with an idea and they're super excited and they start working on it and then at some point they need to decide, ah we need a CEO for this company And some people aren't meant to be CEO's, but for you and John, I've met both of you.

 You're very smart, ambitious people with great qualities that and attributes that correlate to becoming a great leader.

 How did you and John decide you would be the CEO? - Well, I think Stripe is unusual for, John and I are obviously brothers.

 We've known each other for a long time and, and because of the relationship, we're able to place a lot of trust in each other and, we really do run the company together.

 There's no major decision that sort of Stripe has made that's sort of, that we've not both been a part of.

 And it's not always the case that despite being the CEO that I'm the person who like, in the case of disagreement it's not always the case that I prevail.

 Sort of our kind of dispute resolution framework is kinda much more around which of us cares more? Than kind of which one of us holds kind of this title or that.

 I mean John's title is President.

 It's, those kind of sound, both are significant roles.

 And so, yeah in that regard I think we're kind of an anomaly.

 Sort of the fact that I became CEO was honestly semi random.

 And I know it, yeah.

 I think because we're brothers being able to kind of get to this unusual situation where we really do run it together.

 - Great.

 Is there a certain-- - Wait, sorry.

 It may not be a helpful answer because perhaps you're trying to encourage all these companies like shit.

 One of you guys has got to be the CEO but-- - Well, do you think there's like a rubric for this of here are five questions you should answer? Maybe then you decide.

 - That's a good question.

 Hm.

 - Maybe not.

 - Yeah, I'm guessing it's quite, okay well here, I was on one thing which I think it is important just to have an efficient mechanism for reaching a decision and it can't be sort of, simply orange around consensus right? If there's sort of three co-founders and sort of none of you sort of quite want to, or nobodies a clear CEO and you don't have some kind of efficient mechanism for sort of having decisions get made, I think that is a recipe for failure.

 And even I don't know, doing some kind of quasi democratic voting is probably not a great idea either.

 And so for myself with John we kind of both have areas we kind of respectively specialize in, and so that doesn't mean we kind of have absolute autonomy and authority there but we kind of bias in that direction.

 So he spends more time figuring out and working externally with users, I spend more of my time working sort of internally on a lot of product engineering things.

 That's not to say that he doesn't make decisions there or I don't here but again, there's a bias in that direction and then secondly we have this kind of additional aspect where in the case of it being a major decision, and we sort of respectively disagree, then we really do sort of try to make it based on sort of which of us is just kinda, is more passionate about it and because that will correlate with the outcome.

 One of us really wants to do something, or things that X or Y is the right thing to do.

 Simply sort of wanting it to be so passionately is more, I mean that can be kind of a sort of self fulfilling prophecy and so I think it's kind of not irrational to have that be a consideration.

 - Yeah.

 And I also see like the best teams that work well together are the ones in which everyone, they all want the best idea to win, not their idea to win.

 - Definitely.

 - And so there's a stepping back in an unselfish kind of way to get to that conclusion.

 - Definitely and I think that something that we're kind of lucky about that I think is very, well exactly to your point.

 I think it is definitely present in sort of the most successful co-founding relationships that I have seen is some degree of sort of dispassion and disagreement and, for us I think that was kind of easier to get to because we had been disagreeing with each other for 20 years and so it had lost some of the emotional charge, but I think that sort of finding other mechanisms where by you can get there such that it's not sort of this, I don't know, this kinda, the notion of disagreeing strongly is not sort of a scary phenomenon that kinda of both parties or multiple parties if there are more than two are kind of suppressing their feelings for fear of there being this divergence.

 - You have, how many more siblings do you have? Do you have more brother? - One more sibling yes.

 - Okay.

 - Three of us in total.

 - Would you guys, would he join the, or is it just you and John are the, that's a special match there? - Well he, the, Tommy my youngest sibling he's sort of quite a bit younger than myself and John and so, - Oh.

 - John is almost, or is approximately two years younger than I am.

 And when we started Stripe I guess I was about 21 and I think, I guess therefore John was 19.

 And Tommy was still kind of definitively mid way through high school and so, - Ah.

 - just wasn't quite practical at the time.

 - Yes, finish high school.

 And now I think if you asked him he'd probably say he'd never throw his lot in with miscreants like us.

 - Yeah Cool.

 So in terms of the role of CEO, often people say there's a threshold in time in which, and it's related to product market fit where you have a role as a pre-product market fit CEO and then which is completely different in your role as a post-product market fit CEO.

 So I wanna spend up most of our time talking about pre-product market fit but, just to collaborate those questions, what in terms for Stripe what was product market fit for you? Like how did you define it? Were there metrics to it? What number of employees were you at when you reached it? So and so forth.

 - Yeah that's a really good question.

 And I think you're exactly right to kind of divide things in to sort of like there's kind of, the story of a startup is two stories.

 It's a story of getting to product market fit and then the story of kind of what happens subsequently and obviously there isn't like a totally definitive binary line between them but I think it's kind of helpful to frame the narrative in that regard.

 I know it's good for Stripe, and actually around the time we launched publicly I think is basically when we had it in that when we launched publicly in September 2011, we had kind of rebuilt significant components of Stripe kinda multiple times in response to user feedback.

 Like we're kind of on the third version of our dashboard and the second or third depending on how you count major version of our API and so we'd kind of gone through a lot of iteration response to kind of the evident challenges that users had or the deficiencies the product seemed to possess.

 And when we launched, we were basically immediately bottle necked on sort of being able to serve user demand rather than generating user demand.

 And I think sort of directionally that's kind of the, the sort of, the inversion that happens for sort of in the early days you're sort of trying to figure out well okay, kind of conditioned on or given some user, how do I make sure that it does what they need and they end up a happy retained user in a sufficient fraction of cases or whatever.

 And then kind of at some point it flips for okay, this sort of, well, I think it's kind of very different.

 Do you sort of take 100 users and some fraction of them on board and some smaller fraction that remain engaged or whatever and so kind of 100 users that curve sort of accentuates downwards.

 And then you take 100 users and kind of, again a meaningful fraction end up engage and they actually tell more people about it or they sort of invite people and I don't mean kind of strictly just in a viral sense, but just kind of generally speaking.

 Just like kind of lead to and generate more demand such as things, you'd be sort of, in some super linear fashion kind of growing.

 And I think when your sort of, like being kind of less than one is just very different to being more than one And it sort of seems, again when we launched, I mean that didn't generate that many users.

 I mean I don't actually remember but let's just pretend that sort of 500 businesses signed up on the day we launched, but sort of immediately those sort of 500 businesses told other businesses and people had heard about it in all the rest.

 So kind of, the next day we had a lot of businesses as well and so forth.

 Such that from the day we launched the challenge became keeping up with demand rather than tweaking the product to some how serve the market.

 - When you launched how many people were you at at that point please? - We were about 10.

 - 10, okay.

 So, I guess before you launched then, well your day to day sounds like it was just, like we were talking about earlier.

 Just running around talking with users and fixing issues.

 Was that literally every single day was it like that? Or what were you doing everyday? - Okay.

 So not literally every single day but I would say we really tried very hard to sort of understand in sort of very granular detail, what exactly it was that people were doing.

 Where they were tripping up and so on.

 So just to give you some examples, we had a chat room for sort of providing support when people were integrating Stripe and it was actually a public chat room which kind of had some down sides because if we'd broken something or somebody had some kind of embarrassing issues, sort of everyone would see it.

 We thought that was kind of good because it would actually kind of put more pressure on us to sort of have the product be good.

 And we had literally every time sort for the first I don't know, call it 10 users of Stripe, every time somebody sent an API request to Stripe, like it sent an email to us.

 So we were like looking at every single API request And if we saw users do something weird we'd be like well why did they do that right? Or kind of where were our docs confusing or whatever and so I'd go to dinner in the evening or something and I've, well again it seemed like a lot at the time.

 Id have maybe 10 emails because Stripe was not handling a lot of the API requests back then but sort of, you're literally looking at sort of each individual action.

 And actually Stripe, we just kind of celebrated or at least in the passed, we're not very good at celebrating but we passed our seven year anniversary just a few days ago.

 On September 29th and so I was looking at our sort of, we had an hourly stats email that we used to send and so on the day we launched we handled sort of 22 payments in the previous hour and which again sort of seemed huge to us back then.

 But I was noticing in that email, I'd actually forgetting this that we had things like, in the email we literally had a list of businesses that had submitted three or five or something API requests but it'd sort of not gone live.

 They'd not launched their businesses.

 We literally just had the emails of all these businesses.

 The idea was that we would then kind of, we would literally individually reach out to them as like hey, you kind of seem to use Stripe a little bit but you didn't, you didn't go live.

 Like did we screw up or was the prodcut somehow inadequate or whatever? We did things like every time anyone ever hit an error of any sort, that generated like a high priority email to us.

 And so we'd sort of try to immediately go solve it and that also kind of generated sort of I think this pleasant kind of user experience where I mean it's frustrating when you hit an error in some service.

 But we could then often sort of 15 minutes later reach out to them and say hey, we saw that you encountered this problem.

 It's all fixed now.

 And sometimes we did that even in the case where sort of the users made a silly mistake and they'd kind of mistyped an API parameter or something and we'd just reach out to them and be like hey, noticed you had a typo in your code.

 Which perhaps to some of them was a little bit unsettling but, at least kind of helped us increase the kind of the throughput product feedback.

 But so, I mean these are all kind of examples I'd say of the sort of general pattern of sort of really trying to be kind of hyper attentive to all of the micro details of sort of how people were doing the product and kind of iterating rapidly in response to it.

 And generally speaking I think that sort of pre-product market fit metrics are actually relatively unhelpful.

 I think you sort of, you really want to bias very strongly towards kind of as much inspection and kind of high throughput qualitative feedback as possible because probably not that many people are using their product right? And so, if it's 20 users you can kind of in some sense afford to just like look at everything they're doing and try to understand kind of what's working, what isn't? - Yeah in some sense it's how much do they, you can tell subjectively like how much they love your product or how much are they gonna probably be really upset if it just disappears.

 - Totally and actually this point we had a thing at the bottom of every webpage.

 We had a little sort of text box kind of anchorage to the bottom of the sort of, of the browser frame and sort of, kind of one line high sort of text input.

 But we had placeholder texts in it to sort of try to prime people to sort of try and tell us things.

 And so it had, my favorite part of Stripe is ellipses and people just fill it out and can hit enter.

 But we also of course had, most of the problems were negative.

 It was like the worst thing about Stripe is or the worst thing about this page is, or I really hate the way Stripe does or whatever and again we would sort of, sort of at that stage you have to be kind of masochistic and so again we'd be sort of always waking up to all these emails telling us about all the terrible things about Stripe.

 But that was a sort of helpful to do list for the day ahead.

 - How did you stay happy if, like in the early days I mean before I reached the top it's like I have all these complaints.

 - What makes you think we did? So, it was, I would say it was, well happy is such a squishy concept right? And 'cause like, there are lots of things that we, or I guess, when I look back and look, maybe this is the rationalization I taught myself but when I look back at sort of through life at the things that I'm sort of most glad I did, I wasn't exactly happy while doing them.

 Like often I was very stressed out or I had to work really hard or whatever but they're the things that kind of post hoc brought the most fulfillment.

 And, and I think that, well I mean a part of it.

 There's a rich literature here and so I don't wanna kind of dive too deeply into it but I do think kind of happiness is a tricky concept to kind of pin down because is it kind of happiness in the moment? Is it sort of the sense that you have a year later looking back and so on? And so I think language is squishy and it's not completely specifically defined, but I think kind of generally speaking kind of a better utility function and kind of gradient to try to climb is that of fulfillment.

 And so I would say kind of the experience of doing Stripe was, it was not especially happy because we were sort of constantly sort of incredibly aware of all the ways in which the product was severely deficient and all the challenges we faced and I mean it seems sort of, I mean there was no Fin-Tack category back then.

 It was just like two teenagers or just over teenagers trying to compete with PayPal which, many people told us was not an especially kind of promising avenue to pursue.

 And so not especially happy per say but it did feel kind of fulfilling.

 Like I enjoyed working with John and the kind of people we hired.

 It was really fun working with the kinds of kinda customers we were serving, they were just sort of business doing all these kind of wonderful things and they were kind of really smart people.

 And it felt that like, if it worked it could be kind of consequential in the world.

 And so I would say kind of, it sort of felt like I mean, well, I don't know what it feels like to be sort of a scientist or something but I'm guessing when you're sort of pursuing all, you have this kind of big question and you're pursuing all these kind of avenues to sort of try to better understand it and I'm guessing day to day it's sort of not especially happy because most of your experiments don't work or whatever.

 But sort of in, perhaps there's some analog there in terms of it still feels in some sense meaningful.

 - Yeah there, in some sense.

 I mean day to day like you said, you're just running around with your head cut off, but maybe on a weekly or at least monthly basis is just taking a step back and seeing like, what progress have I actually made? 'Cause week to week it's like 1% here, 1% here, it doesn't seem much but from a monthly basis or, maybe longer than that it seems like there's movement.

 - Yeah and I think that's true and I think, I don't want to, like I think it's almost certainly a bad idea to sort of work on a company or to work on anything if you're like truly unhappy working at it right? - Yes.

 - And so there's kind of clearly some balancing act there.

 And I think, I mean a lot of, well there's sort of so many different sort of difficult judgment calls to try to make a startup but of course part of it is like, is something is making you unhappy or if it just doesn't seem like an especially promising avenue or it's not really working or whatever, like your time has relatively high opportunity costs.

 Like you don't get to start that many startups in your life right? And so kind of knowing when to kind of sort of call it quits is I think actually, I mean sort in startup dom we really extol and to uphold the virtues and sort of determination at all costs.

 Never quit and so on.

 And that's clearly not the right answer.

 And like sometimes you should quit.

 And so, so I think kind of what you're getting at is true and right or I think there does need to be sort of some happiness, satisfaction fulfillment.

 There's a good book of that name, Satisfaction which I recommend.

 Kind of week to week, month to month if you're on the right trajectory.

 - Oh man, I wish I had known that I could've, I remember when I was trying to, when I was about to, but Stripe myself, I had these bad memories of trying to implement PayPal and like stacks of documentation and taking like five days to figure it all out.

 And so I sat down and like it's, 'cause you guys are saying go it'd take you 10 minutes.

 I was like no way.

 And it probably took me actually five minutes at that point, and I was super happy.

 I mean that's like, but, maybe I should've sent you a review.

 - Yeah I mean that would've been great especially if the review had sort of criticism for us.

 - But no it was-- - It was really easy.

 - It's definitely helpful to have competitors with not very good products.

 - Yes Okay so, you were, in the early days you were doing a lot of stuff yourself.

 At some point, I guess two part question.

 One is what were the things that you weren't go do at and then two, at what point did you hire someone to, what I assume is to do those things? - Well I mean, I'm not that good at most things right? And I say this in a non sort of false modesty or, I don't mean to be kind of artificially self deprecating but sort of for almost anything that Stripe has to do there are sort of people who are better at that than I am.

 And so I think to some degree sort of the story of say product market fit and to say kind of our current stage is kind of, implementing the recognition of that in kind of more and more areas.

 That said, I think maybe sort of embedded in that question is okay well, acknowledging that you're probably not, that you're probably not the worlds expert in any single thing it's kind of in what order do you sort of replace yourself? And for Stripe the sort of, the important thing we were sort of most obviously not that great at was kind of partnerships and sort of working with the various banks that we have to sort of get on board and so on.

 And so kind of we made, in fact Jeff Ralston who is here in the room today, I think sort of was some combination of sort of very supportive and perhaps in the back of his mind was sort of slightly pitying where he saw us kind of trying to get these partnerships with these kind of big banks in place and we really weren't sort of getting anywhere very fast.

 And so he told us that we had to hire this guy Billy Alveratto and I told just, don't ask me questions.

 Just hire this guy.

 And at the time everyone at Stripe was an engineer and so we just we kinda couldn't quite understand what a non engineer would do.

 Like if you're not writing code what else is there? And so we were kind of suspicious or this idea and we sort of we went back to Jeff and we met Billy and he seemed like a wonderful guy.

 We really liked him but we couldn't quite get past this, okay but like but what does that actually, how does this workout in practice? And so Jeff told us that we should hire Billy and if it didn't work, or if the first few months or whatever, then if it didn't work out Jeff would sort of go back and pay his salary.

 So it was this kind of zero risk move for us.

 And so, and we didn't have a whole lot of money at the time so that was not insignificant.

 So, we hired Billy and that was sort of an immediately trajectory changing event where previously when we'd gone and talked to a bank I mean I don't know if they're literally doing this but it certainly it felt they were kind of pushing this security button under their desk.

 Like why are these guys in my office? And then suddenly things started to go kind of much more smoothly.

 And Billy is still with Stripe today and has been an enormously kind of pivotal presence.

 And so that was, turned out to be very helpful advice.

 - That is interesting.

 Jeff as an inflection point for Stripe.

 Never knew.

 Cool.

 So it sounds like you had hired actually people before Billy.

 I guess your very first hire, the third person between, with you and John was an engineer I'm assuming? Like-- - Well he actually wasn't an engineer.

 But he joined Stripe and he started to become an engineer.

 So, like he'd written a little bit of code previously but he joined and there was a lot of code that had to be written.

 It was a guy I know from college.

 He's actually also Irish and, yeah but we had a lot of code to be written and so he was the kind of person who would sort of survey the landscape and just do whatever it was, was most important and required.

 At that time it was writing code.

 And so, off he went.

 - So kind of the transition from pre-product market fit to post-product market fit, a lot of CEO's when they think back, this is like the one point in which they think aw, I could've done that better.

 So, how did you grade your success of that transition? 'Cause of a lot of it is just taking stuff, delegating stuff better and doing other functions of the business.

 So, what exactly was your transition like and, how would you, how could I if I was going in your shoes tell that I was doing it well? - Yeah so I don't think I did it especially well.

 I mean I think kind of fortunately sort of it worked out but I think if I was doing it all over again I think we could've sort of accelerated ourselves by a year or two if we'd sort of gone about it in a somewhat more disciplined and kind of self aware fashion.

 I think the, I think one of those kind of pernicious sort of mental models you can have here is the kind of, you are on some growth curve and it is sort of your job to sustain or marginally inflect upwards or kind of somehow, you know that, what's that? Is curling the sport where you're kind of wiping the ice while the whatever it is the weight proceeds down the line? Sorry I'm not Canadian but, and but kind of somehow you're kind of making kind of these very small interventions and perturbations on some kind of underlying growth curve.

 I think that's an easy mental model to have and I think it's kind of actively kind of fallacious and mistaken.

 I think that a much better mental model to have is you're serving some market and the market is I mean for, it's relatively finite in size.

 I mean you can always change the crutch and increase the market size but sort of, you can think of it as being finite.

 And then there's sort of the percentage of the market that you're serving.

 And then whatever percentage you are not serving is kind of well you just haven't built the sort of, go to market functions and organization that's kind of capable or at least has yet sort of brought the product to those market segments and they kind of, the growth curve or adoption curve is just kind of a function of that go to market apparatus but basically it's not some kind of cosmic trajectory.

 It's something kind of very much of your creation and under your control.

 And so what I, what we did not do but wish we did, is kind of maybe, well whatever.

 Just after we launched we, there's a whole bunch of kind of immediate scaling work we had to do but say six months after launch, we should've sort of mapped out the kind of concentric circles of our market, like maybe those kind of very early stage startups that were kind of our sort of initial constituency.

 Then those kind of all technical startups but not necessarily very early stage and then there was kind of, I don't know, you keep going these kind of success increments until eventually you get to say all companies handling online payments or something right? And gone and sort of figured out okay, kind of what's the size of this market? Sort of, kind of what fraction are we currently serving? What would it take to serve more and so on? And I think it's quite striking you see that when kind of repeat founders kind of go and start companies, they almost invariably are willing to kind of build the organization post-product market fit.

 So it's invariably willing to kind of build the organization ahead of where things are today.

 Which I think is exactly the right thing to do because they're thinking okay, I have the right product.

 Now let's kind of work backwards from okay, what would the organization look like that was serving the entire market and let's just start building that organization because again the growth curve is under my control.

 And of course it's not like 100% under your control but I think it's much more under your control then some people tend to think.

 There's also of course a difference here, a major difference when you, I think you have sort of a consumer versus kind of B2B use cases.

 For consumer it's a bit more I mean, people don't necessarily know exactly what they want.

 Once the market size for like a news reading app or a dating app or something.

 I mean it's, it kind of, it depends a lot on the products.

 Like maybe way more people should be reading news or something.

 But for sort of a, some service or product that sort of serves a discreet logical concrete function, that's sort of a set of businesses or entities definitely have or don't have I think it's kind of much more rational and much more mappable.

 And I partly had this epiphany when, Aaron Levie who's the CEO of Box, John and I eventually, we sort of had done Polo Alto.

 We moved up to San Francisco.

 I don't, well Aaron Levie had Facebook messaged John and we'd never heard of him and we hadn't heard of most people in Silicon Valley.

 But he'd Facebook massaged us like very early on asking to invest in Stripe.

 And I think John didn't know.

 Who's this random guy? And so we never replied and but then we heard of Box and we heard of Aaron and we read his funny Tweets and all the rest and so we moved to San Francisco and we invited him to our house warming.

 I think it was the first time we'd ever met him.

 And sort of, like we're not very good at partying and so by sort of 11 p.

m.

 or midnight or something kind of everyone was going home and, but Aaron was still there and Aaron stayed until like 2 a.

m.

 I sort of remember kind of sitting in our front room telling us how much better it was to be building B2B software then consumer software for this reason.

 Remember I said consumer software, it's so hard to predict sort of what people want, they don't even know themselves what they want.

 You're kind of, you're, it's such an amorphous space.

 Whereas when you're selling software to businesses, businesses are kind of, are mostly rational, are mostly, I don't know what the opposite of inscrutable is, scrutable I guess and you can sort of work backwards in a way that sort of, it's just much more comprehensible and so I still have this kind of, it's like the angel and demon on your shoulder.

 I still have sort of 2 a.

m.

 Aaron Levie sitting on my shoulder sort of extolling the virtues of building software for entities that know what they want.

 - You've made the right choice.

 Yeah in some sense there's a lot less variables or consumer there's a lot more variables to consider and they're quite unknown.

 Let's take a step back.

 You talked a little bit about thinking about, thinking ahead about why your team is or what your company structure is gonna look like, how do you, maybe this is too big of a question so maybe we can whittle it down a little bit but how do you think about that? Like I'm sitting, if I'm starting a startup today, I'm close to maybe product market fit but before that stage.

 Like am I thinking about this sort of thing? Like what should my team look like? What should my culture be and stuff like that? - I think that well, okay.

 So, pre-product market fit, I mean the goal is, really is just to guess your product market fit.

 And so I actually wouldn't bother thinking too much about all these kind of distribution mechanics questions.

 Now you can get product market fit sort of relatively quickly and so kind of that pre-product market fit stage might only last six months.

 You're not necessarily like Stripe where you're kind of in it for various reasons for several multiple years.

 And so it may not last very long.

 However, until that point I really think you should just be thinking about okay, how do I get there? The main thing that I think companies screw up at the pre-product market fit stage is sort of speed of iteration.

 I think okay well, what determines? Or you kind of speed of fruitful iteration in that sort of, I mean if you're kind of completely, or if you're repeatedly re-building your product but sort of not in response to user feedback I mean that's kind of far less likely to be kind of bringing you in sort of a I don't know, in a productive direction.

 But if you have some kind of meaningful, I'll be it perhaps smalls of initial set of users and you're rapidly iterating a response to sort of their feedback and sort of observed behavior and so on then I think that's like a really good spot to be in.

 And I think again at that juncture of pre-product market fit it is kind of this, you should be sort of doing everything you can to tighten that sort of feedback cycle.

 There's a fighter pilot in, or who kind of revolutionized air born combat in the U.

S.

 in sort of the second half of the 20th century the Korean War and onwards called Boyd and he had this concept of the OODA loop which was sort of, a sort of a similar notion of the most, in a previous, you go far you want to just like the fastest aircraft or sort of the most sophisticated weaponry and so on.

 Where he was all about sort of, no you actually wanted to air craft and sort of pilots in training that are really oriented around sort of the fastest sort of responsiveness in iteration to the kind of particulars of the situation.

 In a way that kind of subsequently went on to to really inform sort of modern aircraft design.

 And so I think you wanna be like, one of these sort of modern fighters where you're sort of really optimized to sort of respond as quickly as possible to sort of rapidly evolving situations.

 Again in this kind of pre-product market stage.

 And so from a hiring standpoint I think it should really be about okay well, what's gonna sort of, what's gonna get you there faster? And I mean I think at an early stage it's most likely well, sort of just people who will help you kind of build a product.

 But of course not too many because, I mean at some point, like, being able to do more, but you might actually be less responsive 'cause you're bigger team to manager or something right? And so as an empirical matter, it seems that somewhere in between kind of two and 10 depending on exactly what you're building is kind of the optimally responsive size.

 But I think it really is about that sort of time from observed sort of necessity of deficiency or this sort of characteristic of your users behavior to executed fix more improvement.

 And for whatever it is that kind of minimizes that.

 - Is there, I mean you say two to 10 which is helpful but is there, are there observations or evidence in which you have hit the peak.

 Like you should not add an extra, like this extra person - I see.

 - is gonna be negative value add to the whole operation.

 - Yeah I mean every person, every person, well, startups in general involve all these kind of impossibly difficult sort of judgment calls and this kind of, high dimensional possibilities phase and so it'd be great if you could sort of collapse it down into a kind of a friendly set of trade offs.

 I just, I don't think you can.

 However I think in principle, calculations you're trying to run is okay, each successful person takes time to hire.

 And so slows us down in that regard.

 Takes time to onboard, slows us down in that regard, kinda takes times to I don't know just kind of meld with the sort of culture and learn the stack, all that stuff.

 That also takes cost and time.

 Then involves subsequent ongoing costs which is like coordination and alignment and sort of, you sort of now have, the organizations that distributed across more neurons and so there's that kind of persistent tax.

 And that's not just necessarily a linear cost but it can be sort of quadratic or something kind of giving the multi way communication problem.

 So you have all these costs to an additional person and so the question is okay, but this person can also help us to like get more shit done right? They can write more code or talk to more users or whatever and so it's kind of, is that fixed benefit to sort of that additional person worth all these other costs and again I think with the ultimate R biter being, will we be more responsive to what we're learning about our users given the presence to this additional person and I think whether or not you will be depends on the complexity of the product and the complexity of the market and all that stuff.

 But I think that's in principle the calculation you ought to be running.

 - I've heard you say, and speaking of hiring people, I've heard you say the key qualities that you look for in a future Stripe employee is intellectually honest, cares a great deal and just loves getting things done.

 Which are great attributes because some people just don't fit in those categories.

 So, it's good to have the separation there.

 How do you, when you meet someone how do you figure out this is the right person? - It's very hard and I wish I had a more sort of definitive rubric.

 And kind of particular set of questions.

 Although if I had a particular set of questions, maybe they'd stop working because kind of, people would learn how to game them or something.

 And so, I mean, well it's hard to fake just being smart right? And so that one's kind of not as hard to discern.

 And I, it's oddly hard to fake being intellectually honest.

 And sort of the characteristics of kind of being able to see multiple sides of a debate or an argument.

 Like there are so many kind of complicated questions for sort of the only thing that I'm really skeptical of is kind of certainty in either direction.

 Just 'cause the questions are intrinsically sort of, involve very contingent trade offs.

 It's also, it's not impossible but it's hard-ish to fake just being nice.

 Like something we hear a lot about at Stripe is just sort of people who are pleasant and warm and just sort of make others happier as a result of their presence.

 And if, well, perhaps if you can fake that perfectly forever maybe that's fine right? - Pretty much.

 - But yeah.

 They're all sort of actually, there's no clear rubric for them and I'm not sure - Sure.

 - that a clear rubric could even work.

 - Yeah.

 So, you talk about, like get people who help move the organization faster if at all possible.

 And I think there are two issues usually that start slowing down the organization as you start scaling just 'cause each person adds just more complexity to the organization but also, I think one is asymmetric information.

 Just people don't want, like are never on the same page.

 And I think you've talked a lot about this I think and so everyone can Google around for lectures you've given on this on, you've done email transparency, obviously having metrics transparent to the whole organization.

 But the second problem to that is, if you fix that there's also this asymmetric interpretation problem which is, everyone's there's this like black box function that how people interpretate, even if all the inputs are the same the outputs are all different and it's, especially at your skill now it's nearly impossible to figure out everybody's function.

 So, when you're thinking about creating your organization and building it out, like how do you reduce that? Reduce that noise and try and get everyone on the same page? - Yeah, well the first thing is I wish we had actually, between say five and 50 people, I think we are much too consensus oriented.

 We of course weren't completely consensus oriented.

 I mean we couldn't have gotten anything done if we were.

 But I think we kind of biased too much in that direction.

 And again if I was doing all, it's just not that efficient, right? And sort of, it's necessarily not the case.

 And so kind of, like you can sort of perhaps maintain some kind of fiction for more or less time but sort of ultimately speaking there is no way of sort of sustaining that.

 And I think that's a relatively common mistake right? Because you almost invariably come from some kind of end musketeers for sort of small and sort of, kind of orientations where sort of, there's no particular need for sort of formal decision making mechanisms or sort of subsequent communication of said decisions or whatever right? But then you kind of, you hit 15 people and either is and I think kind of companies don't adjust quickly enough to sort of that new necessity.

 Again very much us included.

 And so I actually think we did relatively well on the kind of ambient availability of sort of context and information and so on.

 But actually kind of in some sense poorly at sort of deliberate explicit communication of decisions.

 Decisions being I mean actual kind of tactical decisions or even bigger decision like what are our priorities in the next six months or things of that nature.

 And so, the hybrid piece of advice and perhaps I'm over extrapolating from our personal experience, but the hybrid advice just kind of reflecting back would be to kind of, it's kind of like the pre and post-product market fit thing.

 But it's actually about the size of the organization where it kind of, if you hit a certain size and maybe, I'm just gonna say 10 people for the sake of simplicity, maybe it's a bit before, maybe it's a bit after, I think you need to kind of adjust more deliberately to this kind of explicit communication model of sort of, of being sort of quite firmly non consensus based and sort of, I mean nobody likes the idea of sort of being hierarchical.

 That sounds pejorative but like in some sense hierarchal.

 - Sort of the top down, like it does move things faster.

 Maybe some people don't like that but it does move faster.

 - Yes.

 That's right, that's right and there is this kind of delicate balancing act you wanna sort of orchestrate where kind of on the one hand, you want to sort of really prioritize speed and agility which involves being kind of somewhat hierarchical because those are sort of efficient sort of symmetry breaking mechanisms and ways to sort of to have shots get called.

 But on the other hand you really do want people to have those kind of strong ownership mentality and real sense that sort of they can cause things to change or identify problems or sort of inject new ideas even in unrelated areas.

 And so it's this sort of delicate act where I mean you definitely can be excessively hierarchical.

 But sort of how do you sort of facilitate enough autonomy and agency but also not have things devolve into this kind of I don't know sort of, uniform morass of sort of, I don't know all these kind of, of brownie and motion.

 And I think that's hard and requires all these kind of ongoing sort of tweaks and nudges.

 And I mean it's dependent on the personalities involved and all the rest and again I really wish there was the kind of the sort of row simple.

 I'll just do X, Y and Z and you'll be good.

 But sort of if such X Y's and Z's exist I'm, no one's told me yet.

 - If only there was a formula for everything - If only.

 - So riding on the same theme, as Stripe grows, you strike me as a company that does the opposite of most companies which as they get bigger they just slow down and they get less innovative but for you guys and it's hard to even keep up like, you're just pumping out new products and which seem to be successful to me like Stripe Atlas, Stripe Press, Stripe Terminal so on and so forth.

 So, in the early days, when there's just nine or 10 of you if someone had a new idea it's probably really easy to get to you and then you guys would decide.

 How has that changed over time to make sure that someone who's like six degrees away from you, that a good idea actually gets to you? And then how is that decision made to actually execute upon it? - Well I'm, it's very nice to hear you say that you feel like we're getting faster as we get bigger because we're constantly sort of self flagellating over how like frickin' slow we are and like paranoid about sort of, I don't know, degenerating into I don't know, some kind of I don't know sort of immobile stupor.

 And so to whatever extent we do get things done or appear fast I think it's largely because we, we're very paranoid in this dimension and I think that kind of the default outcome of companies or course as they scale is to become sort of more ossified and rigid and sort of, closed to new ideas and directions and things that contradict their prevailing orthodoxies and all of that.

 As to how we kind of avoid that, I mean well, there's lots of kind of obvious things like partly it's sort of, I mean having leaders who care about the rate of progress and just love seeing things happen quickly and lots of things of that nature, I think maybe sort od deeper rooted this, we try to be a kind of yes and culture in that, I mean I personally love just ideas and potential things we could do and I mean most of them are, I mean no matter how good the idea is, sort of we should not pursue most ideas right? Even if independently it could be a super successful company or something but like there is a fairly finite number of things we can do and so sort of, you kind of on the one hand need to recognize that intellectually and just like not pursue most things.

 On the other hand enjoying the exercise and contemplating well, what would it look like if we did it right? And so one thing we do every year for example is we have this kind of crazy ideas process we call it where we literally send a document to the whole company, a hack pod document that's open to everyone and people can sort of add ideas to it, they think are probably a bad idea but if they worked might be a great idea.

 And it's very important that they have to be probably a bad idea because if they're like probably a good idea then I mean it's not that risky and I mean kind of by definition we should probably do it and so whatever.

 Maybe we should just do it.

 And so, people like really self sensor a lot in most organizations because they don't want to look stupid and they don't want to be sort of associated with just having all these like wacky bad ideas and so on and so we try to be fairly firm that if you add ideas to this it has to be probably a bad idea.

 And actually a lot of cool things we've subsequently gone on and done first came from that process.

 Stripe App was being one of them.

 And also we sort of helped Stellar get off the ground, this sort of cryptic currency back a few years ago and sort of that also sort of came from this process.

 And so that's one of the mechanisms by which we try to have that kind of yes and culture.

 And I really think there aren't that many, as just as an empirical matter, there aren't that many large organizations that I think sort of really do this successfully.

 But I think that sort of the most successful larger organizations somehow do succeed in sort of this iterative repeated process of kind of augmentation.

 Amazon and Google being kind of the most prominent examples.

 Where obviously when Google launched there was no Gmail or YouTube or Android or Google Maps or whatever.

 And Amazon sort of is kind of an even more conspicuous example in some sense of this kind of repeated attach at successful ancillary businesses.

 And so I think kind of, yeah it's a very natural temptation as you grow to I think becoming increasingly close to this.

 I think it's very important to avoid.

 - Cool.

 So I have a couple more questions and then maybe we'll have time to take questions from the audience.

 One is, looking back, is there something, did you have a strong opinion of how startups should be run as a CEO that have just completely reversed because you're now the CEO? - That's a good question.

 - Another way to potentially put it is like what are things that you did where you're like I know for sure this should've been done and then it just turned out to be a mistake? - Right.

 Well I already mentioned the sort of, the consensus orientation.

 One that we're going through right now which is a quite sort of significant divergence is we were sort of fairly centralized up until sort of relatively recently.

 I mean we had some remote employees from a pretty early stage but by and large Stripe was kinda concentrated in San Francisco.

 Last week we announced our fourth global hub and basically what we've decided to do is we're gonna have kind of major sort of project and engineering sort of efforts and teams and functions and all the rest in San Francisco, also in Seattle, also in Dublin and also in Singapore.

 And so these non San Francisco locations are not gonna be sort of I don't know, operations offices or satellite offices or places where we do some kind of localization and local market adaptation.

 We want to have kind of completely de novo new products that sort of become super successful started out of these offices.

 And that's not the sort of centered obviously kind of Silicon Valley pattern versus Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google and all these companies tend to be sort of highly concentrated in these sort of very sort of monolithic corporate headquarters.

 And our thesis is that it's kind of several folds.

 Partly that kind of the availability of talent is becoming sort of far more geographically dispersed.

 Partly that sort of the Bay area's becoming increasing untenable expensive location to locate.

 And partly that sort of, we really want Stripe to be global infrastructure that works kind of just as well in sort of Asian markets or in Latin American markets or whatever as it does for businesses in the U.

S.

 and kind of the era of the internet being a predominately North American or North American Western European or whatever, the days of being kind of such a phenomenon are over.

 And so, I think that's sort of a fairly substantial break with kind of descriptive best practice of the past.

 I mean we obviously think it'll work.

 I mean we wouldn't do it if we didn't but it is also kind of on some level risky.

 Like we don't have good prior examples to point to and I mean there's some great companies in Singapore like Grab and Carousel.

 There aren't really sort of any examples yet of sort of American companies establishing kind of major private engineering hubs there.

 We're pretty optimistic it can be done but if it works we'll be the first or one of the first.

 - Cool.

 Last question.

 So in 100 years from now what is Stripe gonna be? What do you imagine it to be? - Well we're only seven years old so that's a, a full question to answer.

 I mean we're trying to build this kind of, this economic infrastructure for the internet and this sort of platform for globalization and kind of I don't know, sort of technological progress in the sense that like it ought to be just as easy to start a company in sort of Nigeria as it is New York and it should be just as easy for somebody in Brazil to buy something sort of from any of these companies as it is for again somebody in the Western world.

 And, it just just seemed so crazy to me that sort of that hasn't happened yet.

 Like I, it sort of feels Stripe should've happened 10 or 20 years before it did and kind of, I don't so much think that we're sort of pursuing this sort of unprecedented kind of path breaking or, sort of inconceivable idea so much as kind of correcting a deficiency in sort of a rip in the fabric of internet infrastructure.

 And so anyway I think we still have at least five years to go in sort of correcting this inadequacy.

 As to what happens after that I'm not sure.

 - Got it.

 In some sense in the future all transactions should be digital and they could very well just all be going through Stripe.

 I mean right now like, in the U.

S.

 someone was telling me like 80% of all Americans have done some transaction through Stripe right? - Yeah that's right.

 So in the last 12 months, more than 80% of American adults have bought something from a Stripe business.

 At least one thing from a Stripe business.

 Which is cool and it's not just the case in the U.

S.

 Like in Singapore where I was last week, that figure is about 70% right? But I guess we don't think about, well I think about it more in terms of the things that are possible or get started as in it's kind of, we think a lot about the rate of sort of new firm creation.

 What companies are getting started, how successful are those companies? Which markets can they serve and so on and every now and again we look back and we look at sort of those kinds of market coverage stats.

 But I guess that's not really what sort of, what motivates it.

 It's more that sort of there are these businesses that should exist and or should be able to offer their products and services in these place where they currently can't and that's I think, I mean, that's the kind of thinking that we use to kind of inform the product and that sort of is kind of the core I don't know, locomotion day to day and then maybe the outcome of that is that I don't know, all these people get to that info from it.

 - Alright.

 Thank you so much Patrick.

 - Cool, thank you.

 - This was great.
