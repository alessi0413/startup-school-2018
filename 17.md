\- So, Patrick, welcome.

那么帕特里克欢迎你

So Patrick is the co founder and CEO of Stripe.

帕特里克是Stripe的联合创始人和首席执行官。

He launched the startup or now pretty big company in 2010 correct? With his brother John.

他在2010年创办了这家初创公司，现在已经是相当大的公司了，对吗？和他弟弟约翰。

\-  Well actually we started working on it full time in 2010 but it actually, to your comment just there about companies launching, it took us quite awhile to launch 'cause we had to get all these banking partnerships in place and so on and so we didn't launch until September 2011.

\- 事实上，我们在2010年就开始全职工作了，但事实上，就你对公司成立的评论来说，我们花了很长一段时间才启动，因为我们必须建立所有的银行合作伙伴关系，等等，所以我们直到2011年9月才推出。

And we'd been working - Oh.

我们一直在工作-哦。

\-  on it for almost two years at that point and every time we saw PG or really anyone else from YC all they would ask us is why we had not launched yet.

\- 差不多两年了，每次我们看到PG或者YC的其他人，他们都会问我们为什么还没有推出。

So some things don't change.

所以有些事情不会改变。

\-  That's interesting.

\- 这很有趣

So two years until you had to-- - Yeah it was I think, - practice.

所以两年之后，你不得不-是的，我想-练习。

\-  one year and 11 months from sort of first line up code to public launch.

\- 一年零十一个月，从第一排代码到公开发布。

Which to be clear I don't recommend.

我不建议你这么做。

That is not a good idea.

这不是个好主意。

Just we had to because we had to kind of get all these other things in place and because it sort of too us so long to have publicly launched, versus, we tried to be very disciplined about sort of gradually expanding the number of users every month and so even though we weren't publicly available, we got our first user, like first production user just kind of freelancing and then every month we tried to add at least kind of a handful of users and so by then we publicly launched and we did have about 100 users which I mean back then to us seems, that's a big deal.

我们不得不这样做，因为我们必须把所有这些东西都准备好，因为我们太久没有公开发布了，与之相比，我们试图非常自律地逐步扩大每个月的用户数量，所以即使我们没有公开的用户，我们也得到了我们的第一个用户，就像第一个生产用户，就像自由职业者和自由职业者一样。然后每个月我们都试着增加至少几个用户，到那时我们公开发布了，我们确实有大约100个用户，我的意思是，在我们看来，这是一个很大的问题。

That's very large.

太大了。

\-  Speaking of, actually when I was preparing for this interview I was trying to jog my memories and I remember specifically because your office was near here in Palo Alto and I remember back then people would always talk about the Collison brothers running around going to peoples offices and like installing their API into the web apps and in true do things don't scale a fashion.

\- 说到，实际上，在我准备这次采访的时候，我试着回忆一下我的记忆，我特别记得，因为你的办公室在帕洛阿尔托(Palo Alto)附近，我记得当时人们总是在谈论科里森兄弟(Collison Brothers)跑来跑去人民的办公室，喜欢把他们的API安装到网络应用程序中，而在真实的情况下，事情并不流行。

And I assume you were not only trying to make sure they installed it but also get user feedback.

我想你不仅试图确保他们安装了它，而且还得到了用户的反馈。

And it happens so much that actually, I don't know if you know Paul Graham, PG, now calls it the Collison Installation.

这种情况经常发生，事实上，我不知道你是否知道保罗·格雷厄姆(PaulGraham)，PG，现在称它为Collison装置。

And this is actually something we give, we tell our founders to go do this.

这实际上是我们给出的东西，我们告诉我们的创始人去做这件事。

Do the Collison Installation 'cause obviously, in the hindsight it seems so obvious to do.

做科里森安装，因为显然，事后看来，这似乎是如此明显的做法。

\-  Well it sort of serves two purposes.

\- 嗯，它有两个目的。

One is your point.

一个是你的重点。

It serves as a really good way to kinda get, to use research and to get kind of UX feedback and so on and I mean if you've done this I'm sure you had the experience where, you design what you're absolutely certain is the most streamlined user friendly straight forward frictionless way to do whatever it is the product does and then you kind of, you plant it and kind of put in front of a user and you just kind of ask them to do whatever it is and they find it completely impenetrable and like they're clicking all the wrong links and they can't find the net button even though the next button is there blinking in green and such.

它是一种很好的方式来获得，使用研究，获得某种UX反馈等等，我的意思是，如果你已经这样做了，我相信你有这样的经验，你绝对可以确定的是，你设计的是最简洁的用户友好的，直接的，无摩擦的方式去做它所做的任何事情，然后你开始种植它，在用户面前，你只需要让他们做任何事情，他们就会发现它是完全不可穿透的，就像他们点击了所有错误的链接，他们找不到网络按钮，即使下一个按钮是绿色闪烁的。

And so it's invariably sort of incredibly painful.

所以这总是让人难以置信的痛苦。

There's sort of nothing so sobering as watching somebody use kind of the first version of some new product.

没有什么比看着某人使用某种新产品的第一个版本更让人清醒的了。

But the other reason for us was, we had suggested to somebody they use Stripe of they switch to Stripe whatever and invariably their response is oh yeah, sure that sounds awesome but it can be, they'll postpone it, they'll postpone it again.

但对我们来说，另一个原因是，我们建议一些人使用Stripe，他们会选择Stripe，他们的反应总是会是哦，是的，这听起来很棒，但是可以，他们会推迟，他们会再次推迟。

Just like there's never a moment where it's like okay this is the evening where I'm going to switch to Stripe.

就像从来没有过这样的时刻，好吧，这是我要转到Stripe的晚上。

And so us going and sort of accosting them in person sort of helped, he'll talk in sales it's always like a why you and a why this and why now? And these kind of questions.

所以我们会亲自帮助他们，他会在销售上说-这就像为什么是你，为什么是现在？还有类似的问题。

And going in person kind of created a why now moment.

亲自去创造了一个为什么是现在的时刻。

It's like well we're here at your house.

就像我们在你家一样。

\-  Did you just show up or how did you? Like what-- - I don't think we ever actually just showed up.

\- 你是刚出现还是怎么出现的？比如-我不认为我们真的会出现。

Although, perhaps we should've but no.

虽然，也许我们应该这样做，但不是。

We tried to be kind of at least semi invited.

我们试着至少是半邀请。

\-  Got it.

\- 明白了

So Stripe now today, I mean you've come a long way since back then.

所以今天你已经走了很长一段路了。

I mean it's not even been, it's probably been a decade.

我的意思是，它甚至没有，可能已经十年了。

Not even.

甚至都没有。

But I mean today you're, well you have 1300 employees across nine offices across the world.

但我的意思是，今天你在世界各地的九个办事处都有1300名员工。

You're doing, I have a list here.

你在做什么，我这里有一份名单。

You manage 200 million API requests a day.

您每天管理2亿个API请求。

You process billions a year for millions of companies across 130 companies.

你每年为130家公司的数百万家公司处理数十亿美元。

Your latest round of fundings, Stripe is now worth 20 million dollars.

你最近一轮的资助，Stripe现在价值2000万美元。

Billion Anyway the list keeps going on but I'm not gonna, I'll stop there otherwise people are gonna think I'm your PR agent.

不管怎么说，名单还在继续，但我不会，我会就此止步，否则人们会认为我是你的公关代理人。

But anyway, you've clearly done something right.

但不管怎样，你显然做对了一些事。

And so I want to spend a lot of, I guess the time today talking about running your startup from the perspective of the startup CEO, you yourself.

所以我想花很多时间，我想今天的时间是从创业CEO的角度来谈论你的创业，你自己。

And it's kind of like zoom.

有点像变焦。

Like what do you think about from zooming in on the day to day operations to zooming out to long term strategic decisions? So maybe to help us ease into the discussion, one thing is when you start off, when from the very beginning a lot of friends get together and they come up with an idea and they're super excited and they start working on it and then at some point they need to decide, ah we need a CEO for this company And some people aren't meant to be CEO's, but for you and John, I've met both of you.

比如，从每天放大操作到放大到长期的战略决策，您会怎么想？所以也许为了让我们轻松地参与讨论，有一件事是当你开始的时候，从一开始就有很多朋友聚在一起，他们想出了一个想法，他们非常兴奋，他们开始工作，然后在某个时候他们需要决定，啊，我们这个公司需要一个CEO，有些人不应该是CEO的，但是为了你和约翰我见过你们俩。

You're very smart, ambitious people with great qualities that and attributes that correlate to becoming a great leader.

你是非常聪明，雄心勃勃的人，有着与成为一个伟大的领导者相关的品质和属性。

How did you and John decide you would be the CEO? - Well, I think Stripe is unusual for, John and I are obviously brothers.

你和约翰是怎么决定要当首席执行官的？-嗯，我认为Stripe是不寻常的，约翰和我显然是兄弟.

We've known each other for a long time and, and because of the relationship, we're able to place a lot of trust in each other and, we really do run the company together.

我们已经认识很久了，因为我们之间的关系，我们能够相互信任，我们确实是一起经营公司的。

There's no major decision that sort of Stripe has made that's sort of, that we've not both been a part of.

没有一个重大的决定是斯特里普做出的，我们都不是其中的一部分。

And it's not always the case that despite being the CEO that I'm the person who like, in the case of disagreement it's not always the case that I prevail.

而且并不总是这样，尽管我是首席执行官，但我是喜欢的人，在意见分歧的情况下，情况并不总是这样，我占上风。

Sort of our kind of dispute resolution framework is kinda much more around which of us cares more? Than kind of which one of us holds kind of this title or that.

某种程度上，我们的争端解决框架更多的围绕着我们中的哪一个更关心？而不是我们中的一个人拥有这样或那样的头衔。

I mean John's title is President.

我是说约翰的头衔是总统。

It's, those kind of sound, both are significant roles.

这些声音都是很重要的角色。

And so, yeah in that regard I think we're kind of an anomaly.

所以，是的，在这方面，我认为我们有点反常。

Sort of the fact that I became CEO was honestly semi random.

老实说，我成为首席执行官的事实是半随机的。

And I know it, yeah.

我也知道，是的。

I think because we're brothers being able to kind of get to this unusual situation where we really do run it together.

我想，因为我们是兄弟，所以我们才能达到这样一种不寻常的情况，那就是我们真的一起经营。

\-  Great.

\- 太好了。

Is there a certain-- - Wait, sorry.

有什么-等等，对不起。

It may not be a helpful answer because perhaps you're trying to encourage all these companies like shit.

这可能不是一个有帮助的答案，因为也许你是在像狗屎一样鼓励所有这些公司。

One of you guys has got to be the CEO but-- - Well, do you think there's like a rubric for this of here are five questions you should answer? Maybe then you decide.

你们中的一个人必须是首席执行官，但是-嗯，你认为这里有五个问题你应该回答吗？也许你会决定。

\-  That's a good question.

\- 这是个好问题.

Hm.

嗯。

\-  Maybe not.

也许不是

\-  Yeah, I'm guessing it's quite, okay well here, I was on one thing which I think it is important just to have an efficient mechanism for reaching a decision and it can't be sort of, simply orange around consensus right? If there's sort of three co-founders and sort of none of you sort of quite want to, or nobodies a clear CEO and you don't have some kind of efficient mechanism for sort of having decisions get made, I think that is a recipe for failure.

\- 是的，我猜这是非常，好吧，在这里，我认为有一件事是很重要的，我认为有一个有效的机制来达成一个决定，它不能是某种程度的，只是橙色的共识，对吗？如果有三位联合创始人，而你们中没有一位想这么做，或者没有一个明确的首席执行官，而且你没有某种有效的机制来做出决定，我认为这是一种失败的处方。

And even I don't know, doing some kind of quasi democratic voting is probably not a great idea either.

即使我也不知道，做某种准民主的投票也不是什么好主意。

And so for myself with John we kind of both have areas we kind of respectively specialize in, and so that doesn't mean we kind of have absolute autonomy and authority there but we kind of bias in that direction.

所以对我来说，对于约翰，我们都有我们各自专门研究的领域，这并不意味着我们在那里有绝对的自主权和权威，但我们在这个方向上有一定的偏见。

So he spends more time figuring out and working externally with users, I spend more of my time working sort of internally on a lot of product engineering things.

所以他花了更多的时间和外部与用户一起工作，我花了更多的时间在内部做很多产品工程方面的工作。

That's not to say that he doesn't make decisions there or I don't here but again, there's a bias in that direction and then secondly we have this kind of additional aspect where in the case of it being a major decision, and we sort of respectively disagree, then we really do sort of try to make it based on sort of which of us is just kinda, is more passionate about it and because that will correlate with the outcome.

这并不是说他没有在那里做决定，也不是说我不在这里，而是在这个方向上有偏见，其次，我们有这样一个额外的方面，如果它是一个重大的决定，我们各自都不同意，那么我们真的会尝试根据我们中的哪一个来做，这是更多的。对此充满激情，因为这将与结果相关。

One of us really wants to do something, or things that X or Y is the right thing to do.

我们中的一个人真的想做些什么，或者X或Y是正确的事情。

Simply sort of wanting it to be so passionately is more, I mean that can be kind of a sort of self fulfilling prophecy and so I think it's kind of not irrational to have that be a consideration.

我的意思是，这可能是一种自我实现的预言，所以我认为，让它成为一种考虑因素并不是不理性的。

\-  Yeah.

\- 是啊

And I also see like the best teams that work well together are the ones in which everyone, they all want the best idea to win, not their idea to win.

我也看到，最好的团队合作得很好，每个人都想要最好的想法去赢得，而不是他们的想法去赢得。

\-  Definitely.

\- 绝对是

\-  And so there's a stepping back in an unselfish kind of way to get to that conclusion.

\- 所以有一种以一种无私的方式来得出这个结论的退一步。

\-  Definitely and I think that something that we're kind of lucky about that I think is very, well exactly to your point.

\- 当然，我认为我们很幸运的是，我认为非常，很好地符合你的观点。

I think it is definitely present in sort of the most successful co-founding relationships that I have seen is some degree of sort of dispassion and disagreement and, for us I think that was kind of easier to get to because we had been disagreeing with each other for 20 years and so it had lost some of the emotional charge, but I think that sort of finding other mechanisms where by you can get there such that it's not sort of this, I don't know, this kinda, the notion of disagreeing strongly is not sort of a scary phenomenon that kinda of both parties or multiple parties if there are more than two are kind of suppressing their feelings for fear of there being this divergence.

我认为这肯定存在于我所见过的最成功的共同建立关系中，这是某种程度上的冷静和分歧，对我们来说，这是比较容易做到的，因为我们20年来一直意见不一，因此失去了一些情感上的负担，但我认为这是寻找其他机制的一种方式。如果你能做到这一点，我不知道，这种强烈反对的概念并不是一种可怕的现象，如果有两个以上的政党或者多个党派，他们会因为害怕出现分歧而压抑自己的感情。

\-  You have, how many more siblings do you have? Do you have more brother? - One more sibling yes.

\- 你还有多少兄弟姐妹？你还有更多的兄弟吗？-还有一个兄弟姐妹-是的.

\-  Okay.

\- 好的。

\-  Three of us in total.

\- 我们一共三个人

\-  Would you guys, would he join the, or is it just you and John are the, that's a special match there? - Well he, the, Tommy my youngest sibling he's sort of quite a bit younger than myself and John and so, - Oh.

\- 伙计们，他会加入吗？还是只有你和约翰，这是一场特别的比赛？-他，汤米，我最小的兄弟，他比我和约翰年轻多了，所以，-哦

\-  John is almost, or is approximately two years younger than I am.

\- 约翰差不多，或者比我小两岁左右。

And when we started Stripe I guess I was about 21 and I think, I guess therefore John was 19.

当我们开始Stripe的时候，我想我大约21岁，我想，所以John才19岁。

And Tommy was still kind of definitively mid way through high school and so, - Ah.

汤米在高中的时候还是有点过半，所以，-啊

\-  just wasn't quite practical at the time.

\- 只是当时不太实际

\-  Yes, finish high school.

\- 是的，完成高中学业.

And now I think if you asked him he'd probably say he'd never throw his lot in with miscreants like us.

现在我想如果你问他，他可能会说他永远不会把自己的命运交给像我们这样的恶棍。

\-  Yeah Cool.

\- 是啊，酷

So in terms of the role of CEO, often people say there's a threshold in time in which, and it's related to product market fit where you have a role as a pre-product market fit CEO and then which is completely different in your role as a post-product market fit CEO.

因此，就CEO的角色而言，人们通常会说，时间是有门槛的，这与产品市场的契合程度有关，你在产品市场上扮演的是适合CEO的角色，而这与你作为产品后市场合适的首席执行官的角色完全不同。

So I wanna spend up most of our time talking about pre-product market fit but, just to collaborate those questions, what in terms for Stripe what was product market fit for you? Like how did you define it? Were there metrics to it? What number of employees were you at when you reached it? So and so forth.

所以我想花大部分时间讨论产品前市场的适合性，但是，为了合作这些问题，对于Stripe来说，什么是适合你的产品市场？比如你是怎么定义的？它有衡量标准吗？当你到达时，你的员工人数是多少？所以，诸如此类。

\-  Yeah that's a really good question.

\- 是的，这是个很好的问题.

And I think you're exactly right to kind of divide things in to sort of like there's kind of, the story of a startup is two stories.

我认为你把事情分成两部分是完全正确的，就像一家初创公司的故事是两个故事。

It's a story of getting to product market fit and then the story of kind of what happens subsequently and obviously there isn't like a totally definitive binary line between them but I think it's kind of helpful to frame the narrative in that regard.

这是一个进入产品市场的故事，然后是后来发生的事情，很明显，他们之间并没有一条完全明确的二元界限，但我认为在这方面构建叙事是有帮助的。

I know it's good for Stripe, and actually around the time we launched publicly I think is basically when we had it in that when we launched publicly in September 2011, we had kind of rebuilt significant components of Stripe kinda multiple times in response to user feedback.

我知道这对Stripe有好处，实际上，在我们公开发布Stripe的时候，我认为基本上是当我们在2011年9月公开发布Stripe的时候，我们对Stripe的一些重要组件进行了多次重建，以响应用户的反馈。

Like we're kind of on the third version of our dashboard and the second or third depending on how you count major version of our API and so we'd kind of gone through a lot of iteration response to kind of the evident challenges that users had or the deficiencies the product seemed to possess.

就像我们在第三个版本的仪表板上，第二个或第三个版本取决于你如何计算我们API的主要版本，所以我们会对用户面临的明显挑战或产品似乎存在的缺陷进行大量的迭代响应。

And when we launched, we were basically immediately bottle necked on sort of being able to serve user demand rather than generating user demand.

当我们推出的时候，我们基本上马上就能满足用户的需求，而不是产生用户的需求。

And I think sort of directionally that's kind of the, the sort of, the inversion that happens for sort of in the early days you're sort of trying to figure out well okay, kind of conditioned on or given some user, how do I make sure that it does what they need and they end up a happy retained user in a sufficient fraction of cases or whatever.

我认为，从方向上看，这是一种，类似于，在早期发生的那种倒置-你试图找出一个很好的，有条件的，或者给某个用户的，如何确保它能满足他们的需要-在足够的情况下，他们最终会成为一个满意的保留用户。

And then kind of at some point it flips for okay, this sort of, well, I think it's kind of very different.

然后，在某种程度上，它转向了好的，这种，嗯，我认为这是非常不同的。

Do you sort of take 100 users and some fraction of them on board and some smaller fraction that remain engaged or whatever and so kind of 100 users that curve sort of accentuates downwards.

你是否接受了100个用户，他们中的一些人在飞机上，还有一些更小的部分仍然保持着参与度，或者其他什么的，比如100个用户，曲线呈下降趋势。

And then you take 100 users and kind of, again a meaningful fraction end up engage and they actually tell more people about it or they sort of invite people and I don't mean kind of strictly just in a viral sense, but just kind of generally speaking.

然后你需要100个用户，再一次，有意义的一小部分最终他们会告诉更多的人，或者他们会邀请一些人，我并不是说严格意义上仅仅是病毒意义上的，而是一般意义上的。

Just like kind of lead to and generate more demand such as things, you'd be sort of, in some super linear fashion kind of growing.

就像引导和产生更多的需求一样，你会在某种程度上，以某种超线性的方式增长。

And I think when your sort of, like being kind of less than one is just very different to being more than one And it sort of seems, again when we launched, I mean that didn't generate that many users.

我认为，当你的那种，比如小于一种，和不止一种完全不同的时候，再一次，当我们发布的时候，我的意思是，没有产生那么多的用户。

I mean I don't actually remember but let's just pretend that sort of 500 businesses signed up on the day we launched, but sort of immediately those sort of 500 businesses told other businesses and people had heard about it in all the rest.

我的意思是，我真的不记得了，但让我们假装在我们成立的那天，有500家企业注册了，但这500家企业马上告诉了其他企业，其他人也都听说过了。

So kind of, the next day we had a lot of businesses as well and so forth.

所以，第二天，我们也做了很多生意，诸如此类。

Such that from the day we launched the challenge became keeping up with demand rather than tweaking the product to some how serve the market.

因此，从我们推出这一挑战的那一天起，我们就开始跟上需求，而不是把产品调整到一些如何为市场服务的地方。

\-  When you launched how many people were you at at that point please? - We were about 10.

\- 当你发射的时候，你当时有多少人？-我们当时大约10岁.

\-  10, okay.

\- 10，好的.

So, I guess before you launched then, well your day to day sounds like it was just, like we were talking about earlier.

所以，我想在你发射之前，你的日常生活听起来就像，就像我们之前所说的。

Just running around talking with users and fixing issues.

只是和用户闲聊，解决问题。

Was that literally every single day was it like that? Or what were you doing everyday? - Okay.

真的是每天都这样吗？或者你每天都在做什么？-好的。

So not literally every single day but I would say we really tried very hard to sort of understand in sort of very granular detail, what exactly it was that people were doing.

所以，并不是每一天-但我要说，我们真的非常努力地去理解一些细枝末节的细节，人们到底在做些什么。

Where they were tripping up and so on.

他们被绊倒的地方等等。

So just to give you some examples, we had a chat room for sort of providing support when people were integrating Stripe and it was actually a public chat room which kind of had some down sides because if we'd broken something or somebody had some kind of embarrassing issues, sort of everyone would see it.

为了给大家举几个例子，我们有一个聊天室，当人们整合Stripe的时候，我们可以提供一些支持。实际上，这是一个公共聊天室，它有一些缺点，因为如果我们破坏了一些东西，或者某个人遇到了一些令人尴尬的问题，那么每个人都会看到它。

We thought that was kind of good because it would actually kind of put more pressure on us to sort of have the product be good.

我们认为这是好的，因为这实际上会给我们带来更大的压力，让产品变得更好。

And we had literally every time sort for the first I don't know, call it 10 users of Stripe, every time somebody sent an API request to Stripe, like it sent an email to us.

我不知道的第一次，我们每一次都有这样的排序，把它称为Stripe的10个用户，每次有人向Stripe发送API请求时，就像它向我们发送了一封电子邮件一样。

So we were like looking at every single API request And if we saw users do something weird we'd be like well why did they do that right? Or kind of where were our docs confusing or whatever and so I'd go to dinner in the evening or something and I've, well again it seemed like a lot at the time.

所以，我们就像查看每个API请求，如果我们看到用户做了一些奇怪的事情，我们就会觉得，为什么他们会这样做呢？或者说我们的医生在哪里搞不懂什么的，所以我晚上会去吃晚饭什么的，我，嗯，在那个时候又感觉好多了。

Id have maybe 10 emails because Stripe was not handling a lot of the API requests back then but sort of, you're literally looking at sort of each individual action.

ID可能有10封电子邮件，因为当时Stripe并没有处理很多API请求，但实际上是在查看每个单独的操作。

And actually Stripe, we just kind of celebrated or at least in the passed, we're not very good at celebrating but we passed our seven year anniversary just a few days ago.

事实上，斯特里普，我们只是有点庆祝，或者至少在过去，我们不是很擅长庆祝，但就在几天前，我们度过了我们的七周年纪念日。

On September 29th and so I was looking at our sort of, we had an hourly stats email that we used to send and so on the day we launched we handled sort of 22 payments in the previous hour and which again sort of seemed huge to us back then.

9月29日，我们收到了一封每小时发送的电子邮件，所以在发布当天，我们在前一个小时处理了大约22笔付款，而这对我们来说也是很重要的。

But I was noticing in that email, I'd actually forgetting this that we had things like, in the email we literally had a list of businesses that had submitted three or five or something API requests but it'd sort of not gone live.

但我在那封电子邮件中注意到，我忘记了这件事，比如，在电子邮件中，我们确实有一张清单，上面列出了提交了三到五个API请求的企业名单，但它似乎还没有实现。

They'd not launched their businesses.

他们还没开始做生意。

We literally just had the emails of all these businesses.

我们刚刚收到了所有这些公司的电子邮件。

The idea was that we would then kind of, we would literally individually reach out to them as like hey, you kind of seem to use Stripe a little bit but you didn't, you didn't go live.

我们的想法是，然后，我们会逐个接触他们，就像嘿，你看上去有点像使用Stripe，但你没有，你没有去现场。

Like did we screw up or was the prodcut somehow inadequate or whatever? We did things like every time anyone ever hit an error of any sort, that generated like a high priority email to us.

就像我们搞砸了，还是不太好？我们所做的事情，就像每次有人碰到任何错误一样，都会产生一封高优先级的电子邮件给我们。

And so we'd sort of try to immediately go solve it and that also kind of generated sort of I think this pleasant kind of user experience where I mean it's frustrating when you hit an error in some service.

所以我们试着马上去解决它，这也是一种产生的用户体验，我认为当你在某个服务中遇到错误时，它是令人沮丧的。

But we could then often sort of 15 minutes later reach out to them and say hey, we saw that you encountered this problem.

但是我们可以经常在15分钟后联系他们，说嗨，我们看到你们遇到了这个问题。

It's all fixed now.

现在都修好了。

And sometimes we did that even in the case where sort of the users made a silly mistake and they'd kind of mistyped an API parameter or something and we'd just reach out to them and be like hey, noticed you had a typo in your code.

有时我们会这样做，即使是在这样的情况下，一些用户犯了一个愚蠢的错误，他们会错误地输入一个API参数或什么的，然后我们就会联系他们，就像嘿，注意到您的代码中有一个错误。

Which perhaps to some of them was a little bit unsettling but, at least kind of helped us increase the kind of the throughput product feedback.

对他们中的一些人来说，这可能有点令人不安，但至少在某种程度上帮助我们增加了吞吐量产品反馈。

But so, I mean these are all kind of examples I'd say of the sort of general pattern of sort of really trying to be kind of hyper attentive to all of the micro details of sort of how people were doing the product and kind of iterating rapidly in response to it.

但是，我的意思是，这些都是我想说的一般模式的例子，它试图对所有的微观细节都高度关注，比如人们是如何做这个产品的，以及对它的快速迭代。

And generally speaking I think that sort of pre-product market fit metrics are actually relatively unhelpful.

一般说来，我认为某种产品前的市场契合标准实际上是相对没有帮助的。

I think you sort of, you really want to bias very strongly towards kind of as much inspection and kind of high throughput qualitative feedback as possible because probably not that many people are using their product right? And so, if it's 20 users you can kind of in some sense afford to just like look at everything they're doing and try to understand kind of what's working, what isn't? - Yeah in some sense it's how much do they, you can tell subjectively like how much they love your product or how much are they gonna probably be really upset if it just disappears.

我想你有点，你真的想非常强烈地倾向于尽可能多的检查和高吞吐量的质量反馈，因为可能没有那么多的人在使用他们的产品，对吗？所以，如果是20个用户，从某种意义上说，你可以喜欢看他们正在做的每件事，试着去理解什么在起作用，什么是不起作用的呢？-是的，从某种意义上讲，是他们有多爱你的产品，你可以主观地判断，比如他们有多喜欢你的产品，或者如果产品消失了，他们可能真的会很难过。

\-  Totally and actually this point we had a thing at the bottom of every webpage.

\- 事实上，这一点在每个网页的底部都有。

We had a little sort of text box kind of anchorage to the bottom of the sort of, of the browser frame and sort of, kind of one line high sort of text input.

我们有一个小的文本框类型的锚定在底部的类型，浏览器框架和某种，类似一行高类型的文本输入。

But we had placeholder texts in it to sort of try to prime people to sort of try and tell us things.

但是我们有占位符文本，试图让人们试着告诉我们一些事情。

And so it had, my favorite part of Stripe is ellipses and people just fill it out and can hit enter.

因此，我最喜欢的部分是椭圆，人们只需填写，就可以点击Enter。

But we also of course had, most of the problems were negative.

但我们当然也有，大部分问题都是负面的。

It was like the worst thing about Stripe is or the worst thing about this page is, or I really hate the way Stripe does or whatever and again we would sort of, sort of at that stage you have to be kind of masochistic and so again we'd be sort of always waking up to all these emails telling us about all the terrible things about Stripe.

这就像是Stripe最糟糕的事情，或者这个页面上最糟糕的事情，或者我真的讨厌Stripe的做法，或者其他什么的，在那个阶段，你必须有点受虐狂，所以我们总是会被这些电子邮件吵醒，告诉我们关于Stripe的所有可怕的事情。

But that was a sort of helpful to do list for the day ahead.

但这是一种有帮助的清单，为未来的一天。

\-  How did you stay happy if, like in the early days I mean before I reached the top it's like I have all these complaints.

\- 你是怎么保持快乐的？就像在我到达顶峰之前，我的意思是，我有很多抱怨。

\-  What makes you think we did? So, it was, I would say it was, well happy is such a squishy concept right? And 'cause like, there are lots of things that we, or I guess, when I look back and look, maybe this is the rationalization I taught myself but when I look back at sort of through life at the things that I'm sort of most glad I did, I wasn't exactly happy while doing them.

\- 你凭什么认为我们这么做了？所以，它是，我会说，它是，那么快乐是这样一个模糊的概念，对吗？因为，有很多事情是我们，或者我想，当我回头看的时候，也许这就是我教会自己的合理化，但是当我回顾生活时，我最高兴的是我所做的事情，我在做这些事情的时候并不是很高兴。

Like often I was very stressed out or I had to work really hard or whatever but they're the things that kind of post hoc brought the most fulfillment.

像很多时候一样，我压力很大，或者我不得不非常努力地工作，或者其他什么的，但是这些都是那种临时带来的最大的满足感。

And, and I think that, well I mean a part of it.

而且，我认为，我是说它的一部分。

There's a rich literature here and so I don't wanna kind of dive too deeply into it but I do think kind of happiness is a tricky concept to kind of pin down because is it kind of happiness in the moment? Is it sort of the sense that you have a year later looking back and so on? And so I think language is squishy and it's not completely specifically defined, but I think kind of generally speaking kind of a better utility function and kind of gradient to try to climb is that of fulfillment.

这里有丰富的文献，所以我不想太深入地研究它，但我确实认为，幸福是一个棘手的概念来确定，因为它是一种幸福的时刻吗？是不是有一种感觉，一年后你会回顾过去，以此类推？所以我认为语言是模糊的，没有完全明确的定义，但是我认为一般来说，一种更好的效用函数和一种渐变来尝试爬升是一种满足。

And so I would say kind of the experience of doing Stripe was, it was not especially happy because we were sort of constantly sort of incredibly aware of all the ways in which the product was severely deficient and all the challenges we faced and I mean it seems sort of, I mean there was no Fin-Tack category back then.

所以我想说的是，做条纹画的经历并不是特别快乐，因为我们一直对产品严重缺陷的所有方式以及我们所面临的所有挑战都有着难以置信的意识，我的意思是，在那个时候，似乎没有Fin-tack这一类别。

It was just like two teenagers or just over teenagers trying to compete with PayPal which, many people told us was not an especially kind of promising avenue to pursue.

这就像两个青少年或者仅仅是为了和贝宝竞争，很多人告诉我们，这并不是一种特别有希望的途径。

And so not especially happy per say but it did feel kind of fulfilling.

所以说并不是特别高兴，但这确实让人觉得很有成就感。

Like I enjoyed working with John and the kind of people we hired.

就像我喜欢和约翰以及我们雇佣的人一起工作一样。

It was really fun working with the kinds of kinda customers we were serving, they were just sort of business doing all these kind of wonderful things and they were kind of really smart people.

和我们所服务的客户一起工作真的很有趣，他们只是在做一些很棒的事情，而且他们都是非常聪明的人。

And it felt that like, if it worked it could be kind of consequential in the world.

它认为，如果它成功了，它可能会在世界上产生某种影响。

And so I would say kind of, it sort of felt like I mean, well, I don't know what it feels like to be sort of a scientist or something but I'm guessing when you're sort of pursuing all, you have this kind of big question and you're pursuing all these kind of avenues to sort of try to better understand it and I'm guessing day to day it's sort of not especially happy because most of your experiments don't work or whatever.

所以我会说，我的意思是，我不知道做一个科学家或什么的感觉，但是我猜当你在追求的时候，你有这样的一个大问题，你在寻求各种途径去尝试更好地理解它，我每天都在猜测这是一种方式。因为你的大部分实验都不起作用什么的。

But sort of in, perhaps there's some analog there in terms of it still feels in some sense meaningful.

但在某种程度上，也许有一些类似的东西，从某种意义上来说，它仍然是有意义的。

\-  Yeah there, in some sense.

\- 是的，在某种意义上

I mean day to day like you said, you're just running around with your head cut off, but maybe on a weekly or at least monthly basis is just taking a step back and seeing like, what progress have I actually made? 'Cause week to week it's like 1% here, 1% here, it doesn't seem much but from a monthly basis or, maybe longer than that it seems like there's movement.

我的意思是，就像你说的那样，你只是在四处奔走，砍掉你的头，但也许每周或者至少每月一次，只是后退一步，然后看到，我到底取得了什么进展？因为一周又一周，这里是1%，这里是1%，这看起来并不多，但从一个月的基础上看，或者，也许更长的时间，似乎是有变化的。

\-  Yeah and I think that's true and I think, I don't want to, like I think it's almost certainly a bad idea to sort of work on a company or to work on anything if you're like truly unhappy working at it right? - Yes.

\- 是的，我认为这是真的-我想，我不想这样做，就像我认为在一家公司工作或者在任何事情上工作都是个坏主意，如果你真的不开心的话，对吗？-是的。

\-  And so there's kind of clearly some balancing act there.

\- 很明显，这里有一些平衡的行为。

And I think, I mean a lot of, well there's sort of so many different sort of difficult judgment calls to try to make a startup but of course part of it is like, is something is making you unhappy or if it just doesn't seem like an especially promising avenue or it's not really working or whatever, like your time has relatively high opportunity costs.

我想，我的意思是，很多，有很多不同类型的艰难判断电话，试图创业，但当然，其中的一部分是，是什么让你不高兴，如果它只是不像是一个特别有希望的途径，或它不是真正的工作，或什么，就像你的时间有相对较高的机会成本。

Like you don't get to start that many startups in your life right? And so kind of knowing when to kind of sort of call it quits is I think actually, I mean sort in startup dom we really extol and to uphold the virtues and sort of determination at all costs.

就像你生命中没有那么多创业公司，对吧？所以知道什么时候该放弃，我想实际上，我指的是在创业中，我们真正赞美的那种，不惜一切代价维护美德和决心的那种。

Never quit and so on.

永远不要放弃等等。

And that's clearly not the right answer.

这显然不是正确的答案。

And like sometimes you should quit.

有时候你应该辞职。

And so, so I think kind of what you're getting at is true and right or I think there does need to be sort of some happiness, satisfaction fulfillment.

所以，我认为你得到的是真实的，正确的，或者我认为确实需要一些快乐，满足感。

There's a good book of that name, Satisfaction which I recommend.

有一本很好的书名叫“满足感”，我推荐它。

Kind of week to week, month to month if you're on the right trajectory.

一个星期，一个月，如果你走在正确的轨道上。

\-  Oh man, I wish I had known that I could've, I remember when I was trying to, when I was about to, but Stripe myself, I had these bad memories of trying to implement PayPal and like stacks of documentation and taking like five days to figure it all out.

\- 哦，天哪，我真希望我早知道我本可以，我还记得当我试着去做的时候，当我正要去做的时候，但是我自己，我有一些关于尝试实现贝宝(PayPal)的糟糕记忆，像成堆的文件，花了大约五天的时间来弄清楚这一切。

And so I sat down and like it's, 'cause you guys are saying go it'd take you 10 minutes.

所以我坐了下来，因为你们说要花10分钟。

I was like no way.

我好像没办法。

And it probably took me actually five minutes at that point, and I was super happy.

那时候我大概花了五分钟时间，我非常高兴。

I mean that's like, but, maybe I should've sent you a review.

我是说，也许我应该给你写个评论。

\-  Yeah I mean that would've been great especially if the review had sort of criticism for us.

\- 是的，我是说，这会很棒，尤其是如果这次的评论对我们有批评的话。

\-  But no it was-- - It was really easy.

但不是.真的很容易

\-  It's definitely helpful to have competitors with not very good products.

\- 如果竞争对手的产品不是很好，那肯定是有帮助的。

\-  Yes Okay so, you were, in the early days you were doing a lot of stuff yourself.

\- 是的，好吧，所以，你是，在早期，你自己做了很多事情。

At some point, I guess two part question.

在某种程度上，我想两个部分的问题。

One is what were the things that you weren't go do at and then two, at what point did you hire someone to, what I assume is to do those things? - Well I mean, I'm not that good at most things right? And I say this in a non sort of false modesty or, I don't mean to be kind of artificially self deprecating but sort of for almost anything that Stripe has to do there are sort of people who are better at that than I am.

一个是你没有去做的事情，然后是第二个，在什么时候你雇佣了一个人，我认为是做那些事情？-嗯，我的意思是，我在大多数事情上不太擅长，对吧？我这样说是出于一种非虚假的谦逊，或者，我并不是要被人为地贬低自己，但是对于Stripe必须做的任何事情，都有比我更好的人。

And so I think to some degree sort of the story of say product market fit and to say kind of our current stage is kind of, implementing the recognition of that in kind of more and more areas.

所以我认为，在某种程度上说，产品市场适合，说我们目前的阶段是某种程度上，在越来越多的领域实现了对这一点的认识。

That said, I think maybe sort of embedded in that question is okay well, acknowledging that you're probably not, that you're probably not the worlds expert in any single thing it's kind of in what order do you sort of replace yourself? And for Stripe the sort of, the important thing we were sort of most obviously not that great at was kind of partnerships and sort of working with the various banks that we have to sort of get on board and so on.

话虽如此，我认为也许嵌入到这个问题中是可以的，承认你可能不是，你可能不是世界上的专家，在任何事情上你都可能是世界专家-在某种程度上，你是按照什么样的顺序取代自己的？对于Stripe来说，最重要的是，我们最明显的不太擅长的就是与不同的银行建立合作伙伴关系，以及与不同的银行合作，这些都是我们必须参与的，以此类推。

And so kind of we made, in fact Jeff Ralston who is here in the room today, I think sort of was some combination of sort of very supportive and perhaps in the back of his mind was sort of slightly pitying where he saw us kind of trying to get these partnerships with these kind of big banks in place and we really weren't sort of getting anywhere very fast.

我们这样做了，事实上，今天在这里的杰夫·拉斯顿，我认为这是一种非常支持的组合，也许在他的脑海中，他看到我们试图与这些大银行建立合作关系时，有点遗憾，而我们实际上并没有很快地达成任何进展。

And so he told us that we had to hire this guy Billy Alveratto and I told just, don't ask me questions.

所以他告诉我们必须雇用比利·阿尔韦拉托，而我只是说，别问我问题。

Just hire this guy.

雇这个人就行了。

And at the time everyone at Stripe was an engineer and so we just we kinda couldn't quite understand what a non engineer would do.

当时Stripe的每个人都是工程师，所以我们不太明白非工程师会做什么。

Like if you're not writing code what else is there? And so we were kind of suspicious or this idea and we sort of we went back to Jeff and we met Billy and he seemed like a wonderful guy.

比如如果你不写代码还有什么？所以我们有点怀疑或者这个想法，然后我们回到杰夫身边，我们遇到了比利，他看起来是个很棒的人。

We really liked him but we couldn't quite get past this, okay but like but what does that actually, how does this workout in practice? And so Jeff told us that we should hire Billy and if it didn't work, or if the first few months or whatever, then if it didn't work out Jeff would sort of go back and pay his salary.

我们真的很喜欢他，但我们不能很好地克服这个问题，但是实际上是怎样的，这种锻炼是如何在实践中进行的呢？因此，杰夫告诉我们，我们应该雇用比利，如果它不起作用，或者如果头几个月或其他什么，那么，如果不成功，杰夫会回去支付他的工资。

So it was this kind of zero risk move for us.

所以对我们来说，这是一种零风险的举动。

And so, and we didn't have a whole lot of money at the time so that was not insignificant.

所以，当时我们并没有那么多钱，所以这并不是微不足道的事情。

So, we hired Billy and that was sort of an immediately trajectory changing event where previously when we'd gone and talked to a bank I mean I don't know if they're literally doing this but it certainly it felt they were kind of pushing this security button under their desk.

Like why are these guys in my office? And then suddenly things started to go kind of much more smoothly.

为什么这些人在我办公室？然后突然之间事情开始变得更顺利了。

And Billy is still with Stripe today and has been an enormously kind of pivotal presence.

比利今天仍然和斯特里普在一起，他一直是一种非常重要的存在。

And so that was, turned out to be very helpful advice.

这是非常有用的建议。

\-  That is interesting.

\- 这很有趣。

Jeff as an inflection point for Stripe.

杰夫是条纹的拐点。

Never knew.

从来不知道。

Cool.

凉爽的

So it sounds like you had hired actually people before Billy.

听起来你在比利之前就雇过人了。

I guess your very first hire, the third person between, with you and John was an engineer I'm assuming? Like-- - Well he actually wasn't an engineer.

我想你的第一份工作，也就是你和约翰之间的第三个人，就是我想的工程师吧？实际上他不是工程师。

But he joined Stripe and he started to become an engineer.

但他加入了斯特里普，并开始成为一名工程师。

So, like he'd written a little bit of code previously but he joined and there was a lot of code that had to be written.

所以，就像他以前写过一点代码，但是他加入了，还有很多代码需要编写。

It was a guy I know from college.

是我从大学认识的一个人。

He's actually also Irish and, yeah but we had a lot of code to be written and so he was the kind of person who would sort of survey the landscape and just do whatever it was, was most important and required.

他其实也是爱尔兰人，是的，但我们有很多代码要写，所以他是那种会对景观进行调查，做任何事情的人，这是最重要的，也是最需要的。

At that time it was writing code.

当时它在写代码。

And so, off he went.

所以他走了。

\-  So kind of the transition from pre-product market fit to post-product market fit, a lot of CEO's when they think back, this is like the one point in which they think aw, I could've done that better.

\- 从产品前的市场适应到产品后的市场适应，很多CEO回想起来，这就像是他们想的那样，我本可以做得更好的。

So, how did you grade your success of that transition? 'Cause of a lot of it is just taking stuff, delegating stuff better and doing other functions of the business.

那么，你是如何评价你的转型成功的呢？因为很多事情只是拿东西，更好地委派东西，做生意的其他功能。

So, what exactly was your transition like and, how would you, how could I if I was going in your shoes tell that I was doing it well? - Yeah so I don't think I did it especially well.

那么，你的转变到底是什么样子，你怎么会，如果我以你的身份去告诉你，我做得很好呢？-是的，所以我觉得我做得不是特别好.

I mean I think kind of fortunately sort of it worked out but I think if I was doing it all over again I think we could've sort of accelerated ourselves by a year or two if we'd sort of gone about it in a somewhat more disciplined and kind of self aware fashion.

我的意思是，我觉得幸运的是，这是成功的，但我想如果我再做一次，我想如果我们能以一种更有纪律性和自我意识的方式去做的话，我们可以加快一两年的速度。

I think the, I think one of those kind of pernicious sort of mental models you can have here is the kind of, you are on some growth curve and it is sort of your job to sustain or marginally inflect upwards or kind of somehow, you know that, what's that? Is curling the sport where you're kind of wiping the ice while the whatever it is the weight proceeds down the line? Sorry I'm not Canadian but, and but kind of somehow you're kind of making kind of these very small interventions and perturbations on some kind of underlying growth curve.

我认为，你可以拥有的那种有害的心理模型之一是，你正处于某种增长曲线上，这是你的工作之一，维持或轻微地向上弯曲，或者某种程度上，你知道，这是什么？冰壶运动，你是在擦拭冰，而无论它是什么重量继续下去？对不起，我不是加拿大人，但不知怎么的，你在某种程度上对某种潜在的增长曲线进行了一些很小的干预和干扰。

I think that's an easy mental model to have and I think it's kind of actively kind of fallacious and mistaken.

我认为这是一个简单的心理模型，我认为这是一种积极的谬误和错误。

I think that a much better mental model to have is you're serving some market and the market is I mean for, it's relatively finite in size.

我认为一个更好的心理模型是，你在为一些市场服务，而我指的是市场，它的规模相对有限。

I mean you can always change the crutch and increase the market size but sort of, you can think of it as being finite.

我的意思是，你总是可以改变拐杖，扩大市场规模，但你可以把它看作是有限的。

And then there's sort of the percentage of the market that you're serving.

还有你所服务的市场所占的比例。

And then whatever percentage you are not serving is kind of well you just haven't built the sort of, go to market functions and organization that's kind of capable or at least has yet sort of brought the product to those market segments and they kind of, the growth curve or adoption curve is just kind of a function of that go to market apparatus but basically it's not some kind of cosmic trajectory.

不管你没有达到什么比例，你只是还没有建立起市场功能和组织，这些功能和组织是有能力的，或者至少还能把产品带到市场的各个部分，它们的增长曲线或者采用曲线只是一个进入市场机制的函数，但基本上不是某种宇宙轨迹。

It's something kind of very much of your creation and under your control.

这在很大程度上是你创造的东西，在你的控制之下。

And so what I, what we did not do but wish we did, is kind of maybe, well whatever.

所以我，我们没有做，但希望我们做的，也许，好吧，随便吧。

Just after we launched we, there's a whole bunch of kind of immediate scaling work we had to do but say six months after launch, we should've sort of mapped out the kind of concentric circles of our market, like maybe those kind of very early stage startups that were kind of our sort of initial constituency.

就在我们启动之后，我们需要做大量的即时扩展工作-但是在启动六个月后，我们应该绘制出我们市场的同心圆，就像那些早期的初创企业，它们是我们最初的支持者。

Then those kind of all technical startups but not necessarily very early stage and then there was kind of, I don't know, you keep going these kind of success increments until eventually you get to say all companies handling online payments or something right? And gone and sort of figured out okay, kind of what's the size of this market? Sort of, kind of what fraction are we currently serving? What would it take to serve more and so on? And I think it's quite striking you see that when kind of repeat founders kind of go and start companies, they almost invariably are willing to kind of build the organization post-product market fit.

然后，所有的技术初创公司，但不一定是早期阶段，然后，我不知道，你会继续这样的成功增量，直到最终你可以说所有的公司都是处理在线支付的，对吧？就这样搞明白了，这个市场有多大？我们现在服务的分数是多少？怎样才能提供更多的服务，以此类推？我认为这是相当令人吃惊的，当一些重复的创始人开始创业时，他们几乎总是愿意建立一种组织的产品后市场。

So it's invariably willing to kind of build the organization ahead of where things are today.

所以它总是愿意在今天的事情发生之前建立一个组织。

Which I think is exactly the right thing to do because they're thinking okay, I have the right product.

我认为这是正确的做法，因为他们的想法是好的，我有正确的产品。

Now let's kind of work backwards from okay, what would the organization look like that was serving the entire market and let's just start building that organization because again the growth curve is under my control.

现在让我们从好的角度倒过来，这个组织会是什么样子的服务于整个市场，让我们开始构建这个组织，因为增长曲线再次在我的控制之下。

And of course it's not like 100% under your control but I think it's much more under your control then some people tend to think.

当然，这并不是100%在你的控制下，但我认为它更多的是在你的控制之下，而不是一些人倾向于认为。

There's also of course a difference here, a major difference when you, I think you have sort of a consumer versus kind of B2B use cases.

当然，这里也有不同之处，当你，我认为你有某种消费者和B2B用例的时候，有很大的不同。

For consumer it's a bit more I mean, people don't necessarily know exactly what they want.

对消费者来说，我的意思是，人们不一定确切地知道他们想要什么。

Once the market size for like a news reading app or a dating app or something.

曾经的市场规模，比如新闻阅读应用或者约会应用什么的。

I mean it's, it kind of, it depends a lot on the products.

我是说，这在很大程度上取决于产品。

Like maybe way more people should be reading news or something.

好像更多的人应该看新闻之类的。

But for sort of a, some service or product that sort of serves a discreet logical concrete function, that's sort of a set of businesses or entities definitely have or don't have I think it's kind of much more rational and much more mappable.

但是对于某种，某种服务或产品，它提供了一种谨慎的逻辑上的具体功能，这是一组企业或实体肯定有或没有的-我认为它更理性，更易于映射。

And I partly had this epiphany when, Aaron Levie who's the CEO of Box, John and I eventually, we sort of had done Polo Alto.

我有一个顿悟，亚伦·列维，他是Box的首席执行官，约翰和我，最终，我们做了某种程度的马球。

We moved up to San Francisco.

我们搬到了旧金山。

I don't, well Aaron Levie had Facebook messaged John and we'd never heard of him and we hadn't heard of most people in Silicon Valley.

我不知道，亚伦·列维在Facebook上给约翰发了短信，我们从来没有听说过他，我们也没听说过硅谷的大多数人。

But he'd Facebook massaged us like very early on asking to invest in Stripe.

但他会在Facebook上给我们按摩，就像很早就要求投资Stripe一样。

And I think John didn't know.

我觉得约翰不知道。

Who's this random guy? And so we never replied and but then we heard of Box and we heard of Aaron and we read his funny Tweets and all the rest and so we moved to San Francisco and we invited him to our house warming.

这个随机的家伙是谁？所以我们从来没有回复，但后来我们听说了Box，我们听说了Aaron，我们读了他的搞笑推文和其他的，所以我们搬到了旧金山，邀请他来我们的房子取暖。

I think it was the first time we'd ever met him.

我想这是我们第一次见到他。

And sort of, like we're not very good at partying and so by sort of 11 p.

有点像，我们不太擅长聚会，所以大概是11便士。

m.

m.

or midnight or something kind of everyone was going home and, but Aaron was still there and Aaron stayed until like 2 a.

或者午夜什么的，每个人都回家了，但是亚伦还在那里，亚伦一直呆到2a左右。

m.

m.

I sort of remember kind of sitting in our front room telling us how much better it was to be building B2B software then consumer software for this reason.

我还记得坐在我们的前厅告诉我们，为了这个原因，构建B2B软件比消费者软件要好得多。

Remember I said consumer software, it's so hard to predict sort of what people want, they don't even know themselves what they want.

记得我说过消费软件，很难预测人们想要什么，他们甚至不知道自己想要什么。

You're kind of, you're, it's such an amorphous space.

你是，这是一个如此无定形的空间。

Whereas when you're selling software to businesses, businesses are kind of, are mostly rational, are mostly, I don't know what the opposite of inscrutable is, scrutable I guess and you can sort of work backwards in a way that sort of, it's just much more comprehensible and so I still have this kind of, it's like the angel and demon on your shoulder.

当你向企业销售软件的时候，企业基本上是理性的，我不知道什么是不可理解的，我想是可以理解的，你可以某种方式倒过来工作，这是更容易理解的，所以我仍然有这样的想法，就像天使和恶魔在你的肩膀上一样。

I still have sort of 2 a.

我还有几分。

m.

m.

Aaron Levie sitting on my shoulder sort of extolling the virtues of building software for entities that know what they want.

亚伦·列维坐在我的肩膀上，有点赞美为那些知道自己想要什么的实体构建软件的优点。

\-  You've made the right choice.

\- 你做出了正确的选择

Yeah in some sense there's a lot less variables or consumer there's a lot more variables to consider and they're quite unknown.

是的，从某种意义上说，变量要少得多，消费者要考虑的变量多得多，而且它们都是未知的。

Let's take a step back.

我们退后一步。

You talked a little bit about thinking about, thinking ahead about why your team is or what your company structure is gonna look like, how do you, maybe this is too big of a question so maybe we can whittle it down a little bit but how do you think about that? Like I'm sitting, if I'm starting a startup today, I'm close to maybe product market fit but before that stage.

你谈到了一些关于思考的问题，提前思考你的团队为什么，或者你的公司结构会是什么样子，你，也许这是一个太大的问题，也许我们可以把它缩小一点，但是你是怎么想的呢？就像我正坐着，如果我今天要开始创业，我很接近于产品市场适合，但在那个阶段之前。

Like am I thinking about this sort of thing? Like what should my team look like? What should my culture be and stuff like that? - I think that well, okay.

就像我在想这种事吗？我的团队应该是什么样子？我的文化应该是什么之类的？-我觉得很好，好吧

So, pre-product market fit, I mean the goal is, really is just to guess your product market fit.

所以，产品前市场适合，我的意思是，目标是，真的只是猜测你的产品市场适合。

And so I actually wouldn't bother thinking too much about all these kind of distribution mechanics questions.

所以我不会费心去想所有这些分布力学的问题。

Now you can get product market fit sort of relatively quickly and so kind of that pre-product market fit stage might only last six months.

现在你可以比较快地适应产品市场，所以产品前市场适应阶段可能只持续六个月。

You're not necessarily like Stripe where you're kind of in it for various reasons for several multiple years.

你不一定像Stripe，因为几年来的各种原因，你都在其中。

And so it may not last very long.

因此，它可能不会持续很长时间。

However, until that point I really think you should just be thinking about okay, how do I get there? The main thing that I think companies screw up at the pre-product market fit stage is sort of speed of iteration.

不过，在那之前，我真的觉得你应该好好想想，我该怎么去呢？我认为公司在产品前市场适合阶段出现问题的主要原因是迭代的速度。

I think okay well, what determines? Or you kind of speed of fruitful iteration in that sort of, I mean if you're kind of completely, or if you're repeatedly re-building your product but sort of not in response to user feedback I mean that's kind of far less likely to be kind of bringing you in sort of a I don't know, in a productive direction.

好吧，是什么决定了？或者，在那种情况下，你的迭代速度是有成效的，我的意思是，如果你是完全的，或者你在反复地重新构建你的产品，但不是为了回应用户的反馈-我的意思是，这不太可能让你进入一个我不知道的，在一个有成效的方向上。

But if you have some kind of meaningful, I'll be it perhaps smalls of initial set of users and you're rapidly iterating a response to sort of their feedback and sort of observed behavior and so on then I think that's like a really good spot to be in.

但是如果你有某种有意义的东西，我可能会是一些最初的用户，你正在快速迭代他们的反馈和观察到的行为等等，然后我认为这是一个很好的位置。

And I think again at that juncture of pre-product market fit it is kind of this, you should be sort of doing everything you can to tighten that sort of feedback cycle.

我再次认为，在产品前市场适配的那一刻，你应该尽你所能来收紧这种反馈周期。

There's a fighter pilot in, or who kind of revolutionized air born combat in the U.

美国有一位战斗机飞行员，或者说是他带来了一场革命性的空战。

S.

s.

in sort of the second half of the 20th century the Korean War and onwards called Boyd and he had this concept of the OODA loop which was sort of, a sort of a similar notion of the most, in a previous, you go far you want to just like the fastest aircraft or sort of the most sophisticated weaponry and so on.

在20世纪后半叶，朝鲜战争和此后被称为Boyd的时候，他有一个ODA循环的概念，这是一种类似的概念，在以前，你想要走得更远，就像最快的飞机或者最尖端的武器，诸如此类的东西。

Where he was all about sort of, no you actually wanted to air craft and sort of pilots in training that are really oriented around sort of the fastest sort of responsiveness in iteration to the kind of particulars of the situation.

他说的是，不，你实际上想要的是飞行器和飞行员，他们的训练方向是以最快的速度对具体情况进行迭代反应。

In a way that kind of subsequently went on to to really inform sort of modern aircraft design.

在某种程度上，这种后来的发展确实为现代飞机的设计提供了信息。

And so I think you wanna be like, one of these sort of modern fighters where you're sort of really optimized to sort of respond as quickly as possible to sort of rapidly evolving situations.

所以我认为你想成为这样的一种现代战斗机，在这种情况下，你会得到某种真正的优化，以尽可能快地做出反应，以适应快速发展的情况。

Again in this kind of pre-product market stage.

再一次在这种预产品市场阶段.

And so from a hiring standpoint I think it should really be about okay well, what's gonna sort of, what's gonna get you there faster? And I mean I think at an early stage it's most likely well, sort of just people who will help you kind of build a product.

所以从招聘的角度来看，我认为应该是好的，好吧，怎样才能让你更快的到达那里？我的意思是，我认为在早期阶段，它很可能是很好的，只是一些人将帮助你建立某种产品。

But of course not too many because, I mean at some point, like, being able to do more, but you might actually be less responsive 'cause you're bigger team to manager or something right? And so as an empirical matter, it seems that somewhere in between kind of two and 10 depending on exactly what you're building is kind of the optimally responsive size.

但当然不是太多，因为，我的意思是，在某个时候，你可以做得更多，但你的反应可能不那么积极，因为你对经理或其他事情来说是一个更大的团队，对吗？因此，作为一个经验性的问题，似乎在2到10之间的某个位置，取决于你正在构建的是什么，是一种最优响应的规模。

But I think it really is about that sort of time from observed sort of necessity of deficiency or this sort of characteristic of your users behavior to executed fix more improvement.

但我认为，从观察到的某种缺陷的必要性，或者用户行为的这种特性到执行修复更多的改进，实际上就是这样的一段时间。

And for whatever it is that kind of minimizes that.

不管它是什么，那都会把它减少到最低限度。

\-  Is there, I mean you say two to 10 which is helpful but is there, are there observations or evidence in which you have hit the peak.

\- 是否有，我的意思是说，有2至10，这是有帮助的，但是否，有观察或证据，你已经达到顶峰。

Like you should not add an extra, like this extra person - I see.

就像你不应该加一个额外的人，像这个额外的人-我明白了。

\-  is gonna be negative value add to the whole operation.

\- 会给整个行动增加负值

\-  Yeah I mean every person, every person, well, startups in general involve all these kind of impossibly difficult sort of judgment calls and this kind of, high dimensional possibilities phase and so it'd be great if you could sort of collapse it down into a kind of a friendly set of trade offs.

\- 是的，我的意思是，每个人，嗯，一般来说，初创公司都涉及到所有这些不可能的、困难的判断电话，以及这种高维度的可能性阶段，所以如果你能把它简化成一组友好的权衡，那就太好了。

I just, I don't think you can.

我只是觉得你做不到。

However I think in principle, calculations you're trying to run is okay, each successful person takes time to hire.

但是我认为原则上，你试图运行的计算是可以的，每个成功的人都需要时间来雇佣。

And so slows us down in that regard.

所以在这方面减慢了我们的速度。

Takes time to onboard, slows us down in that regard, kinda takes times to I don't know just kind of meld with the sort of culture and learn the stack, all that stuff.

上船需要时间，在这方面让我们慢下来，我不知道这需要时间，我不知道，只是和那种文化相结合，学习堆叠，诸如此类的东西。

That also takes cost and time.

这也需要花费成本和时间。

Then involves subsequent ongoing costs which is like coordination and alignment and sort of, you sort of now have, the organizations that distributed across more neurons and so there's that kind of persistent tax.

然后是后续的持续成本，就像协调和调整，你现在有了，那些分布在更多神经元上的组织，所以这是一种持续的税收。

And that's not just necessarily a linear cost but it can be sort of quadratic or something kind of giving the multi way communication problem.

这不一定只是一个线性成本，它可以是二次型的，或者是某种给多路通信带来问题的东西。

So you have all these costs to an additional person and so the question is okay, but this person can also help us to like get more shit done right? They can write more code or talk to more users or whatever and so it's kind of, is that fixed benefit to sort of that additional person worth all these other costs and again I think with the ultimate R biter being, will we be more responsive to what we're learning about our users given the presence to this additional person and I think whether or not you will be depends on the complexity of the product and the complexity of the market and all that stuff.

所以你把所有这些费用都给了一个额外的人，所以问题是可以的，但这个人也可以帮我们做更多的事情，对吧？他们可以写更多的代码，或者和更多的用户交谈，所以这是一种固定的好处取决于产品的复杂性和市场的复杂性以及所有这些东西。

But I think that's in principle the calculation you ought to be running.

但我认为原则上这是你应该进行的计算。

\-  I've heard you say, and speaking of hiring people, I've heard you say the key qualities that you look for in a future Stripe employee is intellectually honest, cares a great deal and just loves getting things done.

\- 我听你说过，说到招人，我听你说过，你在未来的Stripe员工身上寻找的关键品质是理智的诚实，非常关心，只是喜欢把事情做完。

Which are great attributes because some people just don't fit in those categories.

这是很好的属性，因为有些人只是不适合这些类别。

So, it's good to have the separation there.

所以，分离很好。

How do you, when you meet someone how do you figure out this is the right person? - It's very hard and I wish I had a more sort of definitive rubric.

你怎么会，当你遇到一个人时，你怎么知道这个人是对的？-这很难，我希望我有一个更明确的红宝石。

And kind of particular set of questions.

还有一些特殊的问题。

Although if I had a particular set of questions, maybe they'd stop working because kind of, people would learn how to game them or something.

虽然如果我有一个特别的问题，也许他们会停止工作，因为某种程度上，人们会学会如何玩他们或什么。

And so, I mean, well it's hard to fake just being smart right? And so that one's kind of not as hard to discern.

所以，我是说，假装聪明是很难的，对吧？这样一个人就不那么难分辨了。

And I, it's oddly hard to fake being intellectually honest.

而我，奇怪的是很难假装在智力上诚实。

And sort of the characteristics of kind of being able to see multiple sides of a debate or an argument.

一种能够看到一场辩论或一场辩论的多个方面的特征。

Like there are so many kind of complicated questions for sort of the only thing that I'm really skeptical of is kind of certainty in either direction.

就像有这么多复杂的问题一样，我唯一怀疑的是在任何一个方向上的确定性。

Just 'cause the questions are intrinsically sort of, involve very contingent trade offs.

仅仅因为这些问题本质上是一种，涉及非常偶然的权衡。

It's also, it's not impossible but it's hard-ish to fake just being nice.

而且，这不是不可能的，但假装只是友好是很难的。

Like something we hear a lot about at Stripe is just sort of people who are pleasant and warm and just sort of make others happier as a result of their presence.

就像我们在Stripe听到的很多事情一样，Stripe只是一些令人愉快和温暖的人，因为他们的存在而使其他人更快乐。

And if, well, perhaps if you can fake that perfectly forever maybe that's fine right? - Pretty much.

如果，好吧，如果你能永远完美地假装，那就好了，对吧？-差不多

\-  But yeah.

但是的

They're all sort of actually, there's no clear rubric for them and I'm not sure - Sure.

实际上，他们没有明确的规则，我也不确定

\-  that a clear rubric could even work.

\- 一个明确的规则甚至可以奏效。

\-  Yeah.

\- 是啊

So, you talk about, like get people who help move the organization faster if at all possible.

所以，你谈论的是，如果可能的话，让那些帮助组织更快发展的人。

And I think there are two issues usually that start slowing down the organization as you start scaling just 'cause each person adds just more complexity to the organization but also, I think one is asymmetric information.

我认为，通常有两个问题开始减缓组织的发展，因为每个人都给组织增加了更多的复杂性，但我认为一个是信息不对称。

Just people don't want, like are never on the same page.

只是人们不想，就像从来就不一样。

And I think you've talked a lot about this I think and so everyone can Google around for lectures you've given on this on, you've done email transparency, obviously having metrics transparent to the whole organization.

我想你已经谈了很多关于这个的话题，所以每个人都可以在谷歌上搜索你在这个问题上的演讲，你已经做过电子邮件透明度，很明显，对整个组织都是透明的。

But the second problem to that is, if you fix that there's also this asymmetric interpretation problem which is, everyone's there's this like black box function that how people interpretate, even if all the inputs are the same the outputs are all different and it's, especially at your skill now it's nearly impossible to figure out everybody's function.

但第二个问题是，如果你解决了这个不对称的解释问题，那就是，每个人都有这样的黑箱函数，人们是如何解释的，即使所有的输入都是相同的，输出也是不同的，尤其是在你的技能上，现在几乎不可能知道每个人的功能。

So, when you're thinking about creating your organization and building it out, like how do you reduce that? Reduce that noise and try and get everyone on the same page? - Yeah, well the first thing is I wish we had actually, between say five and 50 people, I think we are much too consensus oriented.

所以，当你考虑创建你的组织并建立它的时候，比如你如何减少它呢？减少噪音，试着让每个人都在同一页上？-是的，第一件事是，我希望我们真的有，比如说5到50人，我觉得我们太注重共识了。

We of course weren't completely consensus oriented.

当然，我们并不是完全以共识为导向的。

I mean we couldn't have gotten anything done if we were.

我的意思是，如果我们做了什么，我们就什么都干不成了。

But I think we kind of biased too much in that direction.

但我觉得我们在这个方向上有太多偏见了。

And again if I was doing all, it's just not that efficient, right? And sort of, it's necessarily not the case.

再说一遍，如果我都这么做的话，效率就没那么高了，对吧？从某种意义上说，情况不一定是这样的。

And so kind of, like you can sort of perhaps maintain some kind of fiction for more or less time but sort of ultimately speaking there is no way of sort of sustaining that.

所以，就像你可以或多或少地保持某种虚构，但从根本上说，这是无法维持的。

And I think that's a relatively common mistake right? Because you almost invariably come from some kind of end musketeers for sort of small and sort of, kind of orientations where sort of, there's no particular need for sort of formal decision making mechanisms or sort of subsequent communication of said decisions or whatever right? But then you kind of, you hit 15 people and either is and I think kind of companies don't adjust quickly enough to sort of that new necessity.

我认为这是一个比较常见的错误，对吧？因为你几乎总是来自于某种最终的火枪手，它们的方向很小，类似于某种方向，不需要某种正式的决策机制，也不需要随后的某种交流，或者其他的权利吗？。但是如果你有15个人的话，我认为有些公司调整得不够快，没有足够快的速度去适应这种新的需求。

Again very much us included.

我们也包括在内。

And so I actually think we did relatively well on the kind of ambient availability of sort of context and information and so on.

所以我认为我们在环境可用性、上下文和信息等方面做得比较好。

But actually kind of in some sense poorly at sort of deliberate explicit communication of decisions.

但实际上，在某种意义上，在某种程度上不善于刻意地明确地传达决定。

Decisions being I mean actual kind of tactical decisions or even bigger decision like what are our priorities in the next six months or things of that nature.

我指的是实际的战术决定，或者更大的决定，比如我们在接下来的六个月里的优先事项，或者类似的事情。

And so, the hybrid piece of advice and perhaps I'm over extrapolating from our personal experience, but the hybrid advice just kind of reflecting back would be to kind of, it's kind of like the pre and post-product market fit thing.

所以，混合的建议-也许我是从我们个人的经验推断出来的-但是混合的建议只是在某种程度上反反复复，这有点像产品前和后产品市场的契合。

But it's actually about the size of the organization where it kind of, if you hit a certain size and maybe, I'm just gonna say 10 people for the sake of simplicity, maybe it's a bit before, maybe it's a bit after, I think you need to kind of adjust more deliberately to this kind of explicit communication model of sort of, of being sort of quite firmly non consensus based and sort of, I mean nobody likes the idea of sort of being hierarchical.

但实际上它是关于组织的规模，如果你达到一定的规模，也许，为了简单起见，我只想说10个人，也许是在之前，也许是在之后，我认为你需要更谨慎地适应这种明确的沟通模式我的意思是，没有人喜欢有等级观念。

That sounds pejorative but like in some sense hierarchal.

这听起来有点贬义，但在某种意义上却像是等级制度。

\-  Sort of the top down, like it does move things faster.

\- 有点自上而下，就像它确实能更快地移动东西。

Maybe some people don't like that but it does move faster.

也许有些人不喜欢这样，但它的速度确实更快。

\-  Yes.

\- 是的。

That's right, that's right and there is this kind of delicate balancing act you wanna sort of orchestrate where kind of on the one hand, you want to sort of really prioritize speed and agility which involves being kind of somewhat hierarchical because those are sort of efficient sort of symmetry breaking mechanisms and ways to sort of to have shots get called.

这是对的，这是正确的，有一种微妙的平衡行为，你想要在某种程度上编排-一方面，你想要把速度和敏捷性区分开来-这涉及到一定程度的等级，因为这是一种高效的对称破坏机制，也是一种让人发号施令的方法。

But on the other hand you really do want people to have those kind of strong ownership mentality and real sense that sort of they can cause things to change or identify problems or sort of inject new ideas even in unrelated areas.

但另一方面，你真的希望人们有那种强烈的主人翁心态和真正的感觉，他们可以使事物改变或发现问题，甚至在不相关的领域也能注入新的想法。

And so it's this sort of delicate act where I mean you definitely can be excessively hierarchical.

所以，这是一种微妙的行为，我的意思是，你肯定会过于分层。

But sort of how do you sort of facilitate enough autonomy and agency but also not have things devolve into this kind of I don't know sort of, uniform morass of sort of, I don't know all these kind of, of brownie and motion.

但是，你是如何促进足够的自主权和行动的，但也没有把事情发展成这样的-我不知道，类似于那种，我不知道的那种，布朗尼和运动的东西。

And I think that's hard and requires all these kind of ongoing sort of tweaks and nudges.

我认为这很难，需要所有这些不断的调整和推动。

And I mean it's dependent on the personalities involved and all the rest and again I really wish there was the kind of the sort of row simple.

我的意思是，这取决于所涉及的个性以及所有其他人，我真的希望能有这样一种简单的争吵。

I'll just do X, Y and Z and you'll be good.

我只做X，Y和Z，你就好了。

But sort of if such X Y's and Z's exist I'm, no one's told me yet.

但是，如果这样的X，Y，Z的存在，我，还没有人告诉我。

\-  If only there was a formula for everything - If only.

\- 要是一切都有一个公式就好了-要是这样就好了。

\-  So riding on the same theme, as Stripe grows, you strike me as a company that does the opposite of most companies which as they get bigger they just slow down and they get less innovative but for you guys and it's hard to even keep up like, you're just pumping out new products and which seem to be successful to me like Stripe Atlas, Stripe Press, Stripe Terminal so on and so forth.

\- 所以在同一个主题上，随着Stripe的发展，你给我的印象是，你是一家与大多数公司相反的公司-随着公司规模的扩大，他们就会放慢脚步，变得不那么创新，但对你们来说，甚至很难跟上，你们只是在推出新产品，对我来说似乎是成功的，比如Stripe Atlas、Stripe Press、Stripe终端等等。

So, in the early days, when there's just nine or 10 of you if someone had a new idea it's probably really easy to get to you and then you guys would decide.

所以，在早期，当你只有九到十个人-如果有人有了新的想法-很可能很容易找到你，然后你们就会做出决定。

How has that changed over time to make sure that someone who's like six degrees away from you, that a good idea actually gets to you? And then how is that decision made to actually execute upon it? - Well I'm, it's very nice to hear you say that you feel like we're getting faster as we get bigger because we're constantly sort of self flagellating over how like frickin' slow we are and like paranoid about sort of, I don't know, degenerating into I don't know, some kind of I don't know sort of immobile stupor.

随着时间的推移，这种情况是如何改变的，以确保一个离你只有六度的人，一个好的主意真的会影响到你呢？那么，这个决定是如何真正付诸实施的呢？-好吧，我很高兴听到你说我们变得越来越快，因为我们总是自责自己是多么的慢，就像偏执狂一样，我不知道，退化成我不知道的，某种我不知道的那种不动的昏迷。

And so to whatever extent we do get things done or appear fast I think it's largely because we, we're very paranoid in this dimension and I think that kind of the default outcome of companies or course as they scale is to become sort of more ossified and rigid and sort of, closed to new ideas and directions and things that contradict their prevailing orthodoxies and all of that.

因此，无论我们在多大程度上完成了任务或者表现得很快，我认为这很大程度上是因为我们，我们在这个层面上非常偏执，我认为，随着公司规模的扩大，我们的默认结果是变得更加僵化、僵化和某种程度上接近于新的想法和方向，以及那些与他们盛行的正统观念相矛盾的东西。

As to how we kind of avoid that, I mean well, there's lots of kind of obvious things like partly it's sort of, I mean having leaders who care about the rate of progress and just love seeing things happen quickly and lots of things of that nature, I think maybe sort od deeper rooted this, we try to be a kind of yes and culture in that, I mean I personally love just ideas and potential things we could do and I mean most of them are, I mean no matter how good the idea is, sort of we should not pursue most ideas right? Even if independently it could be a super successful company or something but like there is a fairly finite number of things we can do and so sort of, you kind of on the one hand need to recognize that intellectually and just like not pursue most things.

至于我们如何避免这一点，我的意思是，有很多显而易见的事情，比如，在某种程度上，我的意思是，有一些领导人关心进步的速度，只喜欢看到事情发生得很快，还有很多这种性质的事情，我想也许会有更深层次的根源，我们试着成为一种“是”和“文化”，我的意思是我个人喜欢我们可以做的想法和潜在的事情，我的意思是说，不管想法有多好，我们都不应该追求大多数的想法，对吧？即使是独立的，它也可能是一家超级成功的公司，但就像我们可以做的事情一样有限，你一方面需要意识到这一点，而不是追求大多数事情。

On the other hand enjoying the exercise and contemplating well, what would it look like if we did it right? And so one thing we do every year for example is we have this kind of crazy ideas process we call it where we literally send a document to the whole company, a hack pod document that's open to everyone and people can sort of add ideas to it, they think are probably a bad idea but if they worked might be a great idea.

另一方面，在享受锻炼和思考的同时，如果我们做得对，那会是什么样子呢？所以我们每年都要做的一件事就是，我们有这样一个疯狂的想法过程-我们称之为它-我们实际上是把一份文件发送给整个公司，一个向每个人开放的黑客荚文件，人们可以给它添加一些想法，他们认为这可能是一个糟糕的想法，但如果他们工作可能是一个好主意。

And it's very important that they have to be probably a bad idea because if they're like probably a good idea then I mean it's not that risky and I mean kind of by definition we should probably do it and so whatever.

非常重要的是，它们必须是一个坏主意，因为如果它们可能是一个好主意，那么我的意思是，它没有那么高的风险，我的意思是，从定义上来说，我们可能应该这样做，诸如此类。

Maybe we should just do it.

也许我们应该这么做。

And so, people like really self sensor a lot in most organizations because they don't want to look stupid and they don't want to be sort of associated with just having all these like wacky bad ideas and so on and so we try to be fairly firm that if you add ideas to this it has to be probably a bad idea.

所以，在大多数组织中，人们都非常喜欢自我感知器，因为他们不想看起来很蠢，他们不想被和那些古怪的坏想法等联系在一起，所以我们试图变得相当坚定，如果你把想法加进去，这可能是个糟糕的主意。

And actually a lot of cool things we've subsequently gone on and done first came from that process.

事实上，我们后来做的很多很酷的事情都是从这个过程中开始的。

Stripe App was being one of them.

条纹应用就是其中之一。

And also we sort of helped Stellar get off the ground, this sort of cryptic currency back a few years ago and sort of that also sort of came from this process.

此外，我们还帮助恒星起步，几年前，这种神秘的货币也是从这个过程中产生的。

And so that's one of the mechanisms by which we try to have that kind of yes and culture.

因此，这是我们试图获得这种“是”和“文化”的机制之一。

And I really think there aren't that many, as just as an empirical matter, there aren't that many large organizations that I think sort of really do this successfully.

我真的认为没有那么多，作为一个经验性的问题，没有那么多的大型组织，我认为这是真正成功的。

But I think that sort of the most successful larger organizations somehow do succeed in sort of this iterative repeated process of kind of augmentation.

但我认为，那些最成功的大型组织在某种程度上确实在某种程度上成功地实现了这种反复重复的增强过程。

Amazon and Google being kind of the most prominent examples.

亚马逊和谷歌就是其中最突出的例子。

Where obviously when Google launched there was no Gmail or YouTube or Android or Google Maps or whatever.

很明显，当谷歌推出的时候，没有Gmail、YouTube、Android、GoogleMaps或诸如此类的东西。

And Amazon sort of is kind of an even more conspicuous example in some sense of this kind of repeated attach at successful ancillary businesses.

在某种意义上，亚马逊是一个更加突出的例子，在某种意义上，这种重复附加在成功的附属业务上。

And so I think kind of, yeah it's a very natural temptation as you grow to I think becoming increasingly close to this.

所以我认为，是的，这是一种非常自然的诱惑，随着你的成长，我认为越来越接近这个。

I think it's very important to avoid.

我认为这是非常重要的避免。

\-  Cool.

\- 酷

So I have a couple more questions and then maybe we'll have time to take questions from the audience.

所以我还有几个问题，也许我们会有时间回答观众的问题。

One is, looking back, is there something, did you have a strong opinion of how startups should be run as a CEO that have just completely reversed because you're now the CEO? - That's a good question.

第一个问题是，回顾过去，你是否有强烈的看法认为，作为一名CEO，初创企业应该如何运作，而现在你已经成为了CEO？-这是个好问题.

\-  Another way to potentially put it is like what are things that you did where you're like I know for sure this should've been done and then it just turned out to be a mistake? - Right.

\- 另一种可能的说法是，你做了什么事情，就像我所知道的那样，我确信这是应该做的，但结果却是一个错误？-对。

Well I already mentioned the sort of, the consensus orientation.

我已经提到了共识导向的那种。

One that we're going through right now which is a quite sort of significant divergence is we were sort of fairly centralized up until sort of relatively recently.

我们现在正在经历的一个相当大的分歧是，我们是相当集中的，直到最近。

I mean we had some remote employees from a pretty early stage but by and large Stripe was kinda concentrated in San Francisco.

我的意思是，我们有一些早期的远程员工，但总的来说，Stripe是集中在旧金山。

Last week we announced our fourth global hub and basically what we've decided to do is we're gonna have kind of major sort of project and engineering sort of efforts and teams and functions and all the rest in San Francisco, also in Seattle, also in Dublin and also in Singapore.

上周，我们宣布了我们的第四个全球中心，基本上我们决定做的是，我们将有一些重大的项目和工程，类似的努力，团队和功能，以及所有其他的在旧金山，西雅图，都柏林，还有新加坡。

And so these non San Francisco locations are not gonna be sort of I don't know, operations offices or satellite offices or places where we do some kind of localization and local market adaptation.

所以，这些非旧金山的地点，我不知道，运营办公室，卫星办公室，或者我们做一些本地化和当地市场适应的地方。

We want to have kind of completely de novo new products that sort of become super successful started out of these offices.

我们希望有一种全新的新产品，这些新产品从这些办公室开始变得非常成功。

And that's not the sort of centered obviously kind of Silicon Valley pattern versus Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google and all these companies tend to be sort of highly concentrated in these sort of very sort of monolithic corporate headquarters.

与苹果、亚马逊、Facebook和谷歌相比，这不是那种以硅谷为中心的模式，所有这些公司都倾向于高度集中在这种非常单一的公司总部。

And our thesis is that it's kind of several folds.

我们的论断是，它有几个折叠。

Partly that kind of the availability of talent is becoming sort of far more geographically dispersed.

在一定程度上，这种人才的供应正变得更加分散。

Partly that sort of the Bay area's becoming increasing untenable expensive location to locate.

在一定程度上，这种海湾地区正变得越来越难以维持，昂贵的地理位置。

And partly that sort of, we really want Stripe to be global infrastructure that works kind of just as well in sort of Asian markets or in Latin American markets or whatever as it does for businesses in the U.

在某种程度上，我们希望Stripe成为全球基础设施，在某种程度上可以在亚洲市场或拉丁美洲市场上运作，或者对美国的企业同样有效。

S.

s.

and kind of the era of the internet being a predominately North American or North American Western European or whatever, the days of being kind of such a phenomenon are over.

在某种程度上，互联网是一个以北美或北美西欧为主的时代，成为这样一种现象的日子已经结束了。

And so, I think that's sort of a fairly substantial break with kind of descriptive best practice of the past.

因此，我认为这与过去的描述性最佳实践有相当大的不同。

I mean we obviously think it'll work.

我是说我们很明显认为它会成功。

I mean we wouldn't do it if we didn't but it is also kind of on some level risky.

我的意思是，如果我们不这样做，我们是不会这样做的，但这在某种程度上也是有风险的。

Like we don't have good prior examples to point to and I mean there's some great companies in Singapore like Grab and Carousel.

就像我们之前没有很好的例子可以指出，我的意思是，在新加坡有一些伟大的公司，比如RAP和Carousel。

There aren't really sort of any examples yet of sort of American companies establishing kind of major private engineering hubs there.

目前还没有任何美国公司在那里建立大型私人工程中心的例子。

We're pretty optimistic it can be done but if it works we'll be the first or one of the first.

我们非常乐观，这是可以做到的，但如果它成功了，我们将是第一个或第一个。

\-  Cool.

\- 酷

Last question.

最后一个问题。

So in 100 years from now what is Stripe gonna be? What do you imagine it to be? - Well we're only seven years old so that's a, a full question to answer.

那么从现在起100年后，斯特里普会是什么样子？你觉得那是什么？-嗯，我们只有七岁，所以这是一个需要回答的完整问题。

I mean we're trying to build this kind of, this economic infrastructure for the internet and this sort of platform for globalization and kind of I don't know, sort of technological progress in the sense that like it ought to be just as easy to start a company in sort of Nigeria as it is New York and it should be just as easy for somebody in Brazil to buy something sort of from any of these companies as it is for again somebody in the Western world.

我的意思是，我们正试图为互联网和全球化建立这样的经济基础设施和某种我不知道的某种技术进步，在某种意义上说，在尼日利亚建立一家公司就像在纽约一样容易，对巴西的人来说也应该是一样容易的。这些公司中的任何一家都有某种东西，就像西方世界的某个人所做的那样。

And, it just just seemed so crazy to me that sort of that hasn't happened yet.

而且，在我看来，这种事还没有发生，我觉得太疯狂了。

Like I, it sort of feels Stripe should've happened 10 or 20 years before it did and kind of, I don't so much think that we're sort of pursuing this sort of unprecedented kind of path breaking or, sort of inconceivable idea so much as kind of correcting a deficiency in sort of a rip in the fabric of internet infrastructure.

就像我一样，我觉得Stripe早在10到20年前就该发生了，我不认为我们在追求这样一种前所未有的道路破坏，或者，某种不可思议的想法，就像纠正互联网基础设施结构上的缺陷一样。

And so anyway I think we still have at least five years to go in sort of correcting this inadequacy.

因此，无论如何，我认为我们还有至少五年的时间来纠正这一不足。

As to what happens after that I'm not sure.

之后发生了什么我不确定。

\-  Got it.

\- 明白了

In some sense in the future all transactions should be digital and they could very well just all be going through Stripe.

从某种意义上说，在未来，所有交易都应该是数字化的，它们很有可能只是通过Stripe。

I mean right now like, in the U.

我是说，现在，在美国。

S.

s.

someone was telling me like 80% of all Americans have done some transaction through Stripe right? - Yeah that's right.

有人告诉我，大约有80%的美国人通过Stripe做过一些交易，对吗？-是的，这是对的.

So in the last 12 months, more than 80% of American adults have bought something from a Stripe business.

因此，在过去的12个月里，超过80%的美国成年人从Stripe公司购买了一些东西。

At least one thing from a Stripe business.

至少有一件事是来自条纹生意的。

Which is cool and it's not just the case in the U.

这是很酷的，这不仅是在美国的情况。

S.

s.

Like in Singapore where I was last week, that figure is about 70% right? But I guess we don't think about, well I think about it more in terms of the things that are possible or get started as in it's kind of, we think a lot about the rate of sort of new firm creation.

就像我上周在新加坡一样，这个数字大约是70%，对吧？但是我想我们并没有去想，我更多的考虑的是那些可能的事情，或者是开始的事情，就像在某种程度上，我们想了很多关于新公司创建的速度。

What companies are getting started, how successful are those companies? Which markets can they serve and so on and every now and again we look back and we look at sort of those kinds of market coverage stats.

哪些公司正在起步，这些公司有多成功？它们能为哪些市场服务，等等，我们时不时地回顾一下，我们会看到这类市场覆盖率的统计数据。

But I guess that's not really what sort of, what motivates it.

但我想这并不是真正的动机。

It's more that sort of there are these businesses that should exist and or should be able to offer their products and services in these place where they currently can't and that's I think, I mean, that's the kind of thinking that we use to kind of inform the product and that sort of is kind of the core I don't know, locomotion day to day and then maybe the outcome of that is that I don't know, all these people get to that info from it.

更多的是，这些企业应该存在，或者应该能够在他们目前无法提供的地方提供他们的产品和服务-我认为，我的意思是，这是我们用来告知产品的一种想法，这是我不知道的核心，日复一日地移动，然后也许是结果是，我不知道，所有这些人都是从它得到的信息。
