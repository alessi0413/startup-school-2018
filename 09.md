# Gustaf Alstromer - How to Get Users and Grow

Geoff Ralston: On company updates. Please be honest. They're for you and not for us.

关于公司的最新消息。老实说。它们是给你的，不是给我们的。

If you  make them clearly crazy like， "We're never ever launching. We're launching in four million years，"  we'll get the hint. So don't do that. There have been a lot of questions  about the graduation requirement， which was that you had to submit 9 out of 10  weekly updates. This course was originally a 10-week course， and things changed around a little  bit.

如果你让他们很疯狂，就像“我们永远不会发射。我们在400万年后发射”，我们会得到暗示。所以别那么做。有很多关于毕业要求的问题，那就是你必须每周提交10次更新中的9次。这门课程最初是一个为期10周的课程，情况有些变化。

It's actually more of a 9-week course now， and so it was a little  bit difficult for some groups to get going because of our little snafu in the  beginning of the course. Here's the deal. Eight out of nine updates is just fine.  But we're also going to extend the class， actually really two weeks beyond the lecture，  so that there will be plenty of time to do 10 updates， if you so  choose， and you choose to do nine out of 10， but eight out of nine  will be the absolute requirement for consideration for the $10，000 grant. We'll be flexible， but  make them good updates， make them real updates. Another reminder. Those weekly updates are due  11:59 p.m. Every Sunday， Pacific Standard Time. There's been some confusion about that， and we've  written it a number of times， but please recall when that is. Questions， again， about  anything， about your moderators， about your groups， about your updates， please send to Startup School  at Ycombinator.com. My very last note is a reminder to launch if you haven't already.  The only way to find out if you've made something that people would really want  is to have people really use it， so get your products out there， if you  haven't. Now， I'm going to introduce our first speaker who is my esteemed partner at  Y Combinator， Gustaf Alströmer， who in 2012 was part of the group that built the  growth team at Airbnb.

这实际上是一个9个星期的课程现在，所以它是有点困难，一些小组开始进行，因为我们在课程开始时的小失误。事情是这样的。九次更新中有八次是正常的。但是我们也要延长课程的时间，实际上两个星期之后，如果你愿意的话，我们将有足够的时间来做10个更新，而你选择了10个中的9个，但是9个中的8个将是考虑1万美元补助金的绝对要求。我们将是灵活的，但使他们良好的更新，使他们真正的更新。又一个提醒。这些每周更新的时间是太平洋标准时间每周日晚上11:59。这方面有些混乱，我们已经写了很多次了，但请记得什么时候是这样的。问题，同样，关于任何事情，关于你的版主，关于你的小组，关于你的更新，请发送到YCombinator.com的创业学校。我的最后一个便条是提醒你，如果你还没有发布。要知道你是否做了人们真正想要的东西，唯一的方法就是让人们真正使用它，所以，如果你还没有做，就把你的产品拿出来。现在，我将介绍我们的第一位演讲者，他是我尊敬的Y Combinator合伙人古斯塔夫•阿尔斯特勒默，他在2012年曾是Airbnb成长团队的成员。

If you know anything about Airbnb， you know from 2012 for  the next five years， they grew an enormous amount. This is something that Gustaf knows  better or at least as good as anyone in the entire world， so I'm thrilled  to have him talk today about growth.

如果你对airbnb有所了解的话，你知道从2012年起的未来五年里，它的产量会有很大的增长。这是古斯塔夫更了解的事情，或者至少和世界上任何一个人一样好，所以我很高兴他今天能谈论成长。

Gustaf A.: Thank you very much. Before I begin， thank you so much to Steven， Geoff， Adora，  Bill for putting all this together， so we can be here and do this today.  I'm going to stalk about growth. My background before joining YC last summer was being  one of the first person on the growth team at Airbnb and then growing that  team from， I think we were three people in the beginning. This is how many  people were in 2015. We then grew to 100 and 120 people or something like  that. Almost everything I'm talking about today here， I owe this group.

非常感谢。在我开始之前，非常感谢史蒂文，杰夫，阿多拉，比尔把这一切放在一起，这样我们今天就可以在这里做这件事。我要继续谈论成长。在去年夏天加盟YC之前，我的背景是在Airbnb成长团队中成为第一批成长团队成员之一，然后开始成长，我认为我们刚开始时是三个人。这就是2015年的人数。然后我们成长到了100人和120人或者类似的人。今天我所说的一切，都是我欠这群人的。

That's sort of  where I learned all this stuff. Some of the best ways to learn to work  on user growth is to actually work on a growth team.

这就是我学到这些东西的地方。学习用户增长的最好方法就是在成长团队中工作。

I was fortunate to  do that for almost five years of it at Airbnb. Before I start， one of  the questions that might be obvious， the answer might be obvious for some people， but  not for everyone， is sort of like why should we do this? Why is growth  important? I'm surprised how often I actually get this question， but it might be worth  thinking about it for a second. When you make your product， some people think that  if you just put that product into the market， people will come， and people will  start using the product.

我有幸在Airbnb工作了近五年。在我开始之前，其中一个问题可能是显而易见的，答案可能对某些人来说是显而易见的，但并非对所有人来说都是显而易见的，就像我们为什么要这样做一样? 为什么增长是重要的? 我很惊讶我真的经常收到这个问题，但这可能是值得考虑一下。当你生产你的产品时，有些人认为只要你把产品投放市场，人们就会来，人们就会开始使用产品。

In my experience， that's not really how the world works.

以我的经验，这并不是世界的运作方式。

If  you start a startup or a company that's aimed to be a startup， growth is  important because that's actually what a startup is.

如果你创办了一个初创公司，或者一个打算成为初创公司的公司，那么成长是很重要的，因为这正是初创公司的本质所在。

If you make something that has the  potential to be really big， then making that really big is sort of what a  startup is all about. There's actually a post that Paul Graham wrote that is called  "startup equals growth" where he talks about specifically why growth is so important for startups  and why it's not important， why not every company is a startup， or why growth  isn't important for every company， but for startups， it's really， really important.

如果你做了一件有潜力变得非常大的事情，那么把它变得非常大，这就是创业的意义所在。保罗格雷厄姆(paul graham)在一篇题为“创业等于增长”的文章中特别提到了为什么成长对初创公司如此重要，为什么不是每个公司都是初创公司，或者成长对每个公司都不重要，但对初创公司来说，成长真的，真的很重要。

I'll talk in  a second and sort of like what it means to be intentional about growth， but  the first question you kind of have to answer yes to is sort of like  I have a startup， I want to grow， now， how do we go about doing  that? Who is this talk for? In my experience， the kind of things you work  on when you work on user growth started with consumer companies. Those were the kind  of companies that started embracing a lot of the tactics and strategies and technologies that  growth teams were doing. Now， I would argue that almost every company that sells anything  online or get users online should be or could be using a lot of the  skills and knowledge that I'm going to talk about today. You don't need to be  just consumer company. You don't need to be just a social network to apply these  things. These are applicable to a wide range of companies.

我马上就会说出有意增长意味着什么，但是第一个问题是，你必须回答“是”，就像我有一个初创公司，我想要成长，现在，我们该怎么做呢? 这是给谁说的? 根据我的经验，当你在用户增长方面工作时，你所做的事情是从消费公司开始的。正是这些公司开始采用成长型团队所采用的许多策略，策略和技术。现在，我认为，几乎每一家在网上销售任何东西或让用户上网的公司都应该或可能使用我今天将要讨论的许多技能和知识。你不需要只是一个消费者公司。你不需要只是一个社交网络来应用这些东西。这些都适用于广泛的公司。

If you're a B2B company  and are excellent at growth， you have a massive advantage to other companies in your  space because they are probably not going to spend as much time doing growth as  you are. Now， there is one type of companies who this is relevant for but  too early.

如果你是一个B2B公司，并且在成长方面很出色，那么你在你的领域中比其他公司有很大的优势，因为他们可能不会像你一样花那么多时间在成长上。现在，有一种类型的公司与此相关，但为时尚早。

That actually might apply to most of you right now， and this is  why this talk is dangerous because working on growth at the wrong time in your  company's history can be really， really bad for you.

这实际上可能适用于你们大多数人现在，这就是为什么这种说法是危险的，因为在公司历史上错误的时间从事增长工作对你来说是非常非常有害的。

It's sort of like when you  are kind of off to the races a little bit too ahead of time. The  most important thing， which is what a lot of lecturers here at Startup School is  about is how you make something people want and how you actually find a product  market fit.

这就好像你在比赛中有点超前了。最重要的是，这是许多讲师在这里的创业学校是关于你如何使人们想要的东西，你如何真正找到一个适合的产品市场。

If you apply a lot of the things that I'm going to talk  about here to a company that hasn't built something people want or haven't actually found  product market fit， really bad things happen. You will very often， and this is a  very common graph， grow like crazy in the beginning， but then when you realize that  sort of like that fuel that you had isn't fueling anything， it's just fuel that  kind of evaporates， you'll come straight down.

如果你把我在这里要说的很多东西应用到一个公司，这个公司没有建立人们想要的东西，或者实际上还没有找到适合的产品市场，那么就会发生非常糟糕的事情。你会经常，这是一个很常见的图表，一开始会变得很疯狂，但是当你意识到你所拥有的那种燃料并不能为任何东西提供燃料时，你就会直接下降。

That's why it's dangerous， and then I can  go into more details about that in a second， of applying some of these things  before you actually have a product market fit. The first thing I'm talking about today  is going to be around measurement around product market fit because that's actually the most  essential part for continuing growth. Now， do growth teams have impact or are growth teams  sort of like ... How do you know that growth teams actually matter? How do  you know that these things matter? I'm going to talk about it as well.

这就是为什么它是危险的，然后我可以进入更多关于这一点的细节，在你实际有一个产品市场适合之前，应用其中的一些东西。今天我要说的第一件事是围绕产品市场适合度来衡量，因为这实际上是持续增长最基本的部分。现在，成长型团队有影响吗?或者成长型团队就像。。。你怎么知道成长型团队真的很重要? 你怎么知道这些事很重要? 我也要谈谈这件事。

I'm  going to talk about experimentation， but before I get there， I want to tell you  a story from Facebook. This is not a story I came up with myself.

我要说的是实验，但在我到那里之前，我想在Facebook上给你讲一个故事。这不是我自己编的故事。

I  found it on one of the talks from Facebook.

我在Facebook的一次谈话中发现了这一点。

I think it's so essential for  describing the level of impact you can have if you are applying these kind of  skillsets to a company. This is the timeline of Facebook from 2004 to 2015.

我认为，如果你将这些技能应用到一个公司，那么描述你所能产生的影响程度是非常必要的。这是Facebook从2004年到2015年的时间表。

It's  sort of their growth story. Some of this is public. Some of this wasn't. The  one thing Facebook had， they had an excellent data science team from the early days.  They were really good at measuring， sort of like forecasting how big Facebook was going  to be. So back in 2006， 2007， when Facebook has just started the growth team，  they had a bunch of data scientists doing this sort of forecasting. How big will  Facebook eventually be? They looked at all the type of metrics that Facebook had， and  they came to the conclusions that Facebook will be roughly be 400 million users by  2015.

这是他们成长的故事。有些是公开的。有些不是。Facebook有一件事，那就是他们从早期起就拥有一支优秀的数据科学团队。他们真的很擅长测量，就像预测Facebook会有多大一样。所以早在2006年，2007年，当Facebook刚刚开始成长团队时，就有一群数据科学家在做这种预测。Facebook最终会有多大? 他们研究了Facebook拥有的所有类型的指标，得出的结论是，到2015年，Facebook的用户将达到4亿左右。

That was their forecast by using all the data they had. We know that  wasn't really true. They actually started growing really fast in 2008， 2009. This actually， as  a result of something the growth team came up with. Anyone here had an idea  of what would make Facebook grow so fast in 2008， roughly 2007， 2008?

这是他们的预测，通过使用他们所有的数据。我们知道这不是真的。他们实际上在2008年，2009年开始增长非常快。事实上，这是成长团队想出的方法的结果。这里的任何人都知道是什么让Facebook在2008年(大约2007年，2008年)增长如此之快?

Audience: Didn't they open it to high school students?

观众:他们不是向高中生开放了吗?

Gustaf A.: Opening to high school students. Yes， they did， but that wasn't as big of a  growth. Newsfeed was 2005. Sorry? Recession. Recession did not. No. 10 friends on ... Yeah.  That's good.

古斯塔夫A:向高中生开放。是的，他们做了，但这并不是什么大的增长。NewsFeed是2005年的。对不起? 经济衰退。衰退没有发生。十个朋友。。。是的。很好。

That's sort of like the growth story all across.

这就像是一个成长的故事。

Audience: Image tagging.

观众:图像标记。

Gustaf A.: Image tagging. Could've been that.

图像标记。可能是那个。

Audience: [inaudible] .

听众:[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Translations is the answer. So this is surprising for many of you might， maybe， but  this is actually core part of many growth teams is that you want to make  your product available for as many people in the world， and Facebook started sort of  hitting the limit on people that spoke English， and then assumed that people， just because  Facebook was in English and ... Sorry.

古斯塔夫A:翻译就是答案。所以这对你们中的许多人来说可能是令人惊讶的，但这实际上是许多成长团队的核心部分，你想要让你的产品能为世界上同样多的人所用，而Facebook开始对会说英语的人施加限制，然后就认为那些人，仅仅因为Facebook是用英语写的，而且。。。抱歉。

That the content were in your local language  and Facebook were in English， it would continue to scale.

内容是用你当地的语言写的，Facebook是用英语写的，它会继续扩展。

That wasn't the case. They  implemented this new platform that automatically translated Facebook into hundreds of languages， and the growth  re-accelerated. Now the some thing started happen again.

不是这样的。他们实现了这一新的平台，自动将Facebook翻译成数百种语言，并加速了增长。现在这件事又发生了。

I think they call this lockdown. They  were doing very important things.

我想他们把这叫做禁闭。他们在做非常重要的事情。

In 2010， 2011， something very big was happening， and Facebook  had to make some really large changes， to some extent also driven by using data  to figure out these things. Any idea what happened in 2010? It was a really  big acceleration. Mobile.

在2010年，2011年，一些非常重大的事情正在发生，Facebook不得不做出一些非常大的改变，在某种程度上，这也是通过使用数据来解决这些问题来实现的。知道2010年发生了什么吗? 这是一个非常大的加速度。移动。

I heard mobile. So actually what happening is that the data scientists  at Facebook were forecasting Facebook to be about 700 million users， something like that. Because  most of those people using Facebook on computers， they hadn't intended this massive shift that  was happening in 2010， 2011， which is people getting a smartphones. Facebook switching the entire  team， they had even have large training classes for engineers to start learning mobile. This  was the big change that happened then.

我听到移动电话了。所以事实上，Facebook的数据科学家预测Facebook的用户将达到7亿左右，类似的情况正在发生。因为这些人中的大多数在电脑上使用Facebook，他们并不打算在2010年，2011年发生这种大规模的转变，即人们得到一个智能手机。Facebook切换了整个团队，他们甚至还为工程师开设了大型培训班，开始学习移动通信。这是当时发生的重大变化。

And then actually one more thing happened sort  of like in 2013， 2014 where they made a forecast， they were kind of not  hitting the ceiling of growth again， but then something again happened. Any idea what happened  sort of 2013， 2014?

实际上还有一件事发生了，就像在2013年，2014年，他们做了一个预测，他们没有再次触及经济增长的上限，但随后又发生了一些事情。知道2013年，2014年发生了什么吗?

Audience: [inaudible] .  Instagram.  Instagram [inaudible] .

听众:[听不见]。Instagram。Instagram[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Instagram and Whatapps could be good answers.

古斯塔夫A:Instagram和whatapps可能是个不错的答案。

That's not what I'm looking for here.

这不是我要找的。

Audience: Messenger.

送信人。

Gustaf A.: Messenger is a good answer.

信使是个不错的回答。

It's not what I'm looking for. So Facebook actually running  into the ceiling of the internet， the number of people actually that were online， so  they started this thing called internet.org， which was intended to get more people online. They  went to carriers. They basically worked with carriers to get people online to get free  Facebook. This is actually where a very important portion of the continuous growth of Facebook.  Now， what can we learn from this? Well， we can learn that the initial forecast  of Facebook's growth was about 400 million people， but Facebook today is at 2 point，  I don't know， 1， 2.2 billion-user platform， so it's a very large platform， and the  forecast were wrong. Now， the forecast wasn't wrong.

这不是我要找的。所以Facebook实际上撞上了互联网的天花板，实际上有多少人是在线的，所以他们开始了一个叫做internet.org的活动，这个活动的目的是让更多的人在线。他们去了航空母舰。他们基本上是与运营商合作，让人们在网上获得免费的Facebook。这实际上是Facebook持续增长的一个非常重要的部分。现在，我们能从中学到什么? 嗯，我们可以了解到，最初对Facebook增长的预测大约是4亿人，但现在Facebook的用户平台是122亿，我不知道，所以这是一个非常大的平台，预测是错误的。现在，预测并没有错。

It just didn't intend to take into  account everything great that the company was going to do.

它只是不打算考虑到公司将要做的所有伟大的事情。

If there's anything we can  learn from this is that if you're intentional growth and you are really trying to  break through these forecasts and these ceilings， you can grow really， really fast. This applies  to every company.

如果我们能从这里学到什么，那就是，如果你是有意的增长，并且你真的试图突破这些预测和上限，那么你可以真的，真的快速增长。这适用于每个公司。

I show this graph to everyone that joined Airbnb and be like  everyone that joined growth team at Airbnb and try to get them to think in  the same way. So natural adoption， which is sort of like that initial forecast of  how fast your project's growing without any of that work， is always going to eventually  slow down， but if you do the things that you do as a growth team，  you can't continue to push the growth of your company. Now， I mentioned this before.  Having a growth teams before you find product and market fit isn't really useful. So  let's talk about product market fit.

我向每个加入Airbnb的人展示了这张图表，并像每个加入Airbnb成长团队的人一样，试图让他们以同样的方式思考。所以自然的采用，就像最初预测的那样，你的项目在没有任何工作的情况下增长的速度总是会慢下来，但是如果你作为一个成长团队去做，你就不能继续推动你的公司的成长。我之前提到过。在你发现产品和市场合适之前，组建一个成长团队并不是什么有用的事情。所以让我们来谈谈产品的市场适应性。

It's a important term， but it's hard to exactly  define what it is. One way that I think about measuring product market fit is  these two things. First， you find the metric. You can do this for yourself after  this talk. Find the metric that represents the value that your customers get from your  product， and then you measure the repeat usage of that metric.

这是一个重要的术语，但很难确切地定义它是什么。我认为衡量产品市场适合度的一个方法是这两件事。首先，你要找到公制。在这次谈话之后，你可以为自己做这件事。查找表示客户从产品中获得的价值的度量值，然后测量该度量值的重复使用情况。

It sounds pretty simple，  and we'll see， let's see if it works. You can make this kind of table  if you want where you have the company， you have the metric that represents the  value users get from your product and then you have the idea of frequency. So  let's take Airbnb. You get value from Airbnb when you are booking and staying， so  when you're actually traveling Airbnb， that's when you find that Airbnb is really valuable.

听起来很简单，我们会看到，让我们看看它是否有效。如果您想要公司所在的位置，您可以创建这样的表，您有一个表示用户从产品中获得的价值的度量值，然后您就有了频率的概念。那我们就选航空公司吧。当您预订和入住时，您可以从Airbnb获得价值，所以当您实际旅行Airbnb时，您会发现Airbnb确实很有价值。

It's  amazing experience. Unfortunately， people don't do that more than annually， so if you want to  figure out the product market fit of it， Airbnb， you can always ask people after  their first stay， but you wouldn't really know until they book again. When they come  back and book again. Because the booking cycles for traveler's so slow， annual would be  a good metric here. Let's take Facebook. So Facebook， if you come back to Facebook  being and voluntarily coming back to Facebook， as an active user， you're doing that because  you find value.

这是一次奇妙的经历。不幸的是，人们每年都不会这么做，所以如果你想弄清楚它的产品市场适合与否，Airbnb，你可以在人们第一次入住后问他们，但你不会真正知道，直到他们再次预订。当他们回来再预订的时候。因为旅客的预订周期太慢了，在这里每年都是一个很好的指标。我们去Facebook吧。所以Facebook，如果你回到Facebook，作为一个活跃的用户，主动回到Facebook，你这样做是因为你发现了价值。

That's something that makes you come back to Facebook or Instagram or  anything like that.

这会让你回到Facebook或者Instagram之类的网站。

And the question then is how often should I come back? Well，  probably daily or hourly or something like that. They started looking at monthly， and then  they went down to daily.

那么问题是我应该多久回来一次? 嗯，可能是每天或每小时之类的。他们开始每月看一次，然后每天都去看。

I think they might be even going more than that.  Let's talk about Gusto.

我想他们可能还不止这些。我们来谈谈兴趣。

What's the product value as a customer of Gusto that you  get out of using Gusto? Well， when you run your payroll， which is what sort  of what Gusto do for your employees， this is one of best ways to measure  the value you get out of Gusto， and how often do you do that? Well，  you run payroll every other week or every month.

什么是产品的价值，作为一个客户的兴趣，你得到了使用兴趣? 嗯，当你运行你的工资单时，这就是你对员工的兴趣所在，这是衡量你从兴趣中获得的价值的最好方法之一，你多久做一次? 好吧，你每隔一周或每个月开一次工资单。

I'm not going to go into  the details of all of this， but for Lyft， it might be rides. For Checker，  it might be background checks. For Stripe， it might be transactions. Now， for your company，  you should figure out what is the one metric that I can measure easily， every  day or every time it happens， and what's the ideal frequency through which that should  happen? If you can answer those two questions， you can make a cohort analysis of  your own company right now and you can start trying to figure out if you  have product market fit. Then， you want to measure these things， so you take a  graph. On one axis you have time， and the other one you have the metric  that we just decided. From that， you can try to figure out if you have  a product market fit This company is measuring this on a weekly basis. The ideal  use case of this company is using this product on a weekly basis， so every  week here， there's a dot， which is the percent of people that use this product  on Week One. The first time they used it， they used it again. Let's take  Startup School as an example. So I join Startup School， and in Week One， only  60% would come back to Startup School， and then in Week Four， only 30% would  come back. Well， that would suggest that Startup School， we wouldn't be a great product，  but that would be a good way to measure if Startup School is actually a  good product. People come back to all the content that we're creating.

我不打算谈这一切的细节，但对Lyft来说，这可能是骑行。对于检查者来说，这可能是背景检查。对Stripe来说，这可能是交易。现在，对于你的公司来说，你应该弄清楚，我可以很容易地测量的一个指标是什么，每天或者每次都是，理想的频率是多少? 如果你能回答这两个问题，你现在就可以对你自己的公司做一个群组分析，然后你就可以试着找出你是否适合产品市场。然后，你想要测量这些东西，所以你需要一个图表。在一个轴上，你有时间，在另一个轴上，你有我们刚刚决定的度量。从这一点，你可以尝试找出你是否有一个产品市场适合这个公司每周的基础上衡量这一点。这个公司的理想用例是每周使用这个产品，所以在这里，每个星期都有一个点，这是在第一周使用这个产品的人的百分比。他们第一次用的时候，又用了一次。让我们以创业学校为例。所以我加入了创业学校，在第一周，只有60%的人会回到创业学校，然后在第四周，只有30%的人会回来。嗯，这将意味着初创学校，我们不会是一个伟大的产品，但这将是一个很好的方式来衡量，如果创业学校实际上是一个好的产品。人们回到了我们创造的所有内容。

I'll take another  product. This is a great product. This is kind of like a normal product ...  an old product would like because almost always， you have a little bit too many  people in the beginning of the product， and then it will go down over time，  but it will sort of flatten out where you keep measuring these events of your  metrics. This might sound technical， but it's actually just a representation of how many people  each dot it is， how many people that's using your product for that metric that  you decided on that time window. Most good products flatten out. Let's look at some  examples here. So these are examples that based on payment retention. This is a company  that you have all heard of that retains 10% after one month， and then 12%  after 12 months.

我要另一种产品。这是一个伟大的产品。这就像一个普通的产品。。。一个老的产品会喜欢，因为几乎总是，你在产品的一开始就有太多的人，然后随着时间的推移，它会下降，但它会使你在衡量这些事件的时候变得平稳。这听起来像是一种技术，但实际上它只是一种表示，每个点有多少人，有多少人在用你的产品来衡量你在那个时间窗上决定的指标。大多数好产品都变平了。让我们看一些例子。这些都是基于支付保留的例子。这是一个大家都听说过的公司，一个月后保留10%，12个月后保留12%。

It's sort of like unusual. Who can that be?

有点不寻常。那会是谁?

Audience: [inaudible] .

听众:[听不见]。

Male: Stripe.

Stripe。

Gustaf A.: This is too hard. This is Shopify. Shopify have this product where a lot of  people sign up， not that many people continue in Month Two， but then they kind  of stick on forever.

这太难了。这是购物中心。Shopify有这样的产品，很多人在那里注册，不是很多人在第二个月继续，但是他们会一直坚持下去。

What do we know from this? Well， if this curve would  go down to zero or sort of keep going down， then Shopify would be a  bad product.

从这件事我们知道什么? 好吧，如果这条曲线下降到零或者继续下降，那么Shopify将是一个糟糕的产品。

It wouldn't be something that actually found product market fit and shouldn't be  working on growth.

这并不是一件真正适合产品市场的事情，也不应该促进增长。

In this case， they have good product market fit， and they should  be working on growth. They should do all they can to continue working on growth.  They should do something about the initial onboarding here where they lose a lot of  people in the beginning， but they should be working on growth. Here's another company. 50%  retention after one month， and then 10% after 24 months. Sort of similar to Shopify，  but they continue to lose users all the way down to even 24 months. Maybe  there's some flattening out at the very end here， but even 12 months after people  start paying for this product， every month， fewer and fewer pay for the product.

在这种情况下，他们有良好的产品市场适合，他们应该致力于增长。他们应该尽其所能继续致力于经济增长。他们应该对最初的入职做些什么，在那里他们刚开始失去了很多人，但是他们应该致力于成长。这是另一家公司。一个月后保留50%，24个月后保留10%。类似于Shopify，但他们继续失去用户直到24个月。也许在最后会有一些平平，但是即使在人们开始为这个产品付费后的12个月里，每个月的工资也会越来越少。

Is  this a product market fit? Hard to say， but it's not an obvious case that  they have found product market fit. So this is Blue Apron. Here's one that's pretty  good. 70% retention after 12 months， and then 30% after seven years. This company definitely  have a product market fit. Any ideas which company this might be? You're all using  it.

这个产品市场合适吗? 很难说，但这不是一个明显的例子，他们发现产品市场适合。这是蓝色围裙。这里有一个很不错的。12个月后保留70%，7年后保留30%。这个公司绝对有一个产品市场。有没有想过这可能是哪个公司? 你们都在用。

Audience: [inaudible] .

听众:[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Amazon.

亚马逊。

I heard Amazon， but it wasn't the right one.

我听说亚马逊，但它不是正确的一个。

Audience: [inaudible] .

听众:[听不见]。

Gustaf A.: Apple. No. This is Netflix. So 70% of people that start paying for Netflix， pay  for Netflix seven years down the line.

苹果。不。这是Netflix。因此，70%的人开始支付Netflix，支付Netflix7年。

That's definitely a company with product market fit.  They should spend everything they can working on growth. Raise your hand if you're measuring  your retention right now. Not that many people. Well， there are other ways to figure  out retention.

那绝对是一个产品市场适合的公司。他们应该尽其所能致力于经济增长。如果你现在正在测量你的记忆力，举起你的手。没那么多人。嗯，还有其他方法来确定保留。

If you're really small， you should go out and talk to users. You  should ask them questions such as， "How would you feel if you can no longer  use my product?" and should sort of like say as close as you can to  users. This is like measuring retention like this， it's very hard when you have 10  users. When you have 1，000， it's easier. But when you have 10 users， this is  not the way to do it. You can actually go and just talk to all  of them in person. There are other ways to measure it， but you sort of  have to know that you have a product that's retaining. Otherwise， you shouldn't be working  on growth because you're going to end up burning a lot cycles on things that  doesn't matter. A lot of people might be wondering how does growth and marketing relate  to each other? Is it the same thing， or how should I think about it?  Historically， the way you had a company 20 years ago is you had a product  team that made a product， and then you had the marketing team or product marketing  team that marketed the product.

如果你真的很小，你应该出去和用户聊天。你应该问他们这样的问题，“如果你不能再使用我的产品，你会有什么感觉?” 应该尽可能接近用户。这就像测量保持率一样，当你有10个用户时非常困难。如果你有1000，就容易多了。但是当你有10个用户时，这不是方法。你可以亲自去和他们谈。有其他的方法来衡量它，但你必须知道，你有一个产品，是保留。否则，你不应该致力于增长，因为你最终会在不重要的事情上消耗大量的周期。很多人可能会想知道增长和市场营销是如何联系在一起的? 是一回事，还是我该怎么想? 从历史上看，20年前你拥有一家公司的方式是，你有一个产品团队来生产产品，然后你有一个营销团队或产品营销团队来销售产品。

That's how things used to work. A lot of hierarchies  in companies or organizations are still based on this idea that you had a product  team that's separate from the marketing team， and these are different teams and different skillsets，  and engineers work over in the product team， and then the marketing people work over  in the marketing team. Actually， it's not how things work anymore. The way you should  think about this is that， I'm going to come to this in a second， is  that there's three different types of people that can， organizations that can drive growth. There  is what I call a product growth engineering. This has different names. This is effectively  product managers， engineers， data scientists， and sometimes marketers that work on growth， but they work  on growth using technology. They're actively changing the product to drive more growth， and much  of this work here is about people that already arrived to your product but haven't  really found the value of your product， and they're changing the product to make it  grow faster. Conversion optimizations fall into this group. Some of the growth challenge actually fall  into this group. Now， there's this big other group here， performance marketing， which is effectively  Google and Facebook marketing， which is also super technical and super data-driven.

以前就是这样的。公司或组织中的许多层次结构仍然基于这样一种想法，即您有一个与营销团队分开的产品团队，这些团队是不同的团队和不同的技能，工程师在产品团队中工作，然后营销人员在营销团队中工作。事实上，这已经不是事情的运作方式了。你应该这样想，我马上就会说，有三种不同类型的人可以，组织可以推动增长。这就是我所说的产品成长工程。这个有不同的名字。这是有效的产品经理，工程师，数据科学家，有时是市场营销人员，他们工作的增长，但使用技术。他们正在积极地改变产品，以推动更多的增长，这里的大部分工作是关于那些已经到达你的产品，但还没有真正发现你的产品的价值的人，他们正在改变产品，使它更快地增长。转换优化属于这一组。有些增长挑战实际上属于这一群体。现在，这里有一个很大的另一个群体，性能营销，这就是谷歌和Facebook的营销，这也是超级技术和超级数据驱动的。

I would argue  that these things are very， very similar. Five or 10 years ago， you would go  to a company， you would see these being very different groups， maybe different floors in  the office. Now they， in my opinion， should sit together. So engineers should sit together  with performance marketers and vice versa because they actually are doing very similar things. Now，  there's this fifth button， fifth things should be number three here， which is brand marketing.  Brand marketing is sort of like the hardest to measure type of marketing where you're  not really having a direct response， you're not having someone directly giving you feedback on  how that marketing perceived. You can't even measure that very easily， so this is not  something that startups should be doing in the early days.

我认为这些事情是非常非常相似的。五，十年前，你会去一个公司，你会看到这些是非常不同的群体，也许不同的楼层在办公室。现在，在我看来，他们应该坐在一起。因此，工程师应该与绩效营销人员坐在一起，反之亦然，因为他们实际上正在做非常相似的事情。现在，有了第五个按钮，第五个东西应该是这里的第三个，那就是品牌营销。品牌营销是一种最难衡量的营销类型，在这种类型中，你没有直接的反应，也没有人直接给你反馈市场的看法。你甚至不能很容易地衡量这一点，所以这不是初创公司在早期应该做的事情。

In my opinion， startups should  not be brand marketing until way down the line when they hit the limits on  these two things. Startups should be doing these two things， and there's some qualifications through  which you can do this， but almost everyone can do this.

在我看来，初创公司不应该是品牌营销，直到他们达到这两件事的极限。创业公司应该做这两件事，你有资格做这件事，但几乎每个人都能做这件事。

If you're a startup，  you have engineers， you can do product growth or growth engineering or things like that.  All right. Let's talk about that first part， product growth. Your product is a funnel.  What does that mean? Your product has many， many， many steps betweens the first user  and the person sort of like completing what they're trying to do on your product.  Let's say I'm an e-commerce store， and I'm trying to buy something. There are many，  many steps in that funnel， and what the product growth team is working on is  funnel optimization or conversion rate optimization.

如果你是一个初创公司，你有工程师，你可以做产品增长或成长工程之类的事情。那好吧。让我们来谈谈第一部分，产品增长。你的产品是漏斗。那是什么意思? 你的产品在第一个用户和用户之间有很多很多步骤，就像完成他们想要在你的产品上做的事情一样。假设我是一家电子商务商店，我想买点东西。在这个漏斗中有许多步骤，产品开发团队正在进行的是漏斗优化或转化率优化。

If you look at what we did at Airbnb  on the growth team， many of those growth teams were conversation rate， rate optimization teams  that are working a specific part of the funnel. So the funnel could start with  SEO， it could start with performance marketing， it could start with referrals of virality， but  it would jump through a number of different steps. Say signups would be a very  common step. Or if you're an e-commerce site， payment conversation or buying conversion. All of  these steps are things that as a conversation rate optimizing part of the growth team  should be working on. These are the some of the easiest things you got working  on.

如果你看看我们在成长团队Airbnb做了些什么，很多成长团队都是对话率，比率优化团队，他们正在做一个漏斗的特定部分。所以漏斗可以从SEO开始，它可以从性能营销开始，它可以从推荐病毒开始，但它会跳过许多不同的步骤。说签名是很常见的一步。或者，如果你是一个电子商务网站，支付会话或购买转换。所有这些步骤都是作为一种会话率，优化成长团队中的一部分应该进行的工作。这是你做的最简单的事情。

I'm going to be a little bit high level here because to go into  depth about every single area here is going to be， we can go on for  hours. Some of the good ideas， some areas to start working on for conversation rate  optimizations， one of them is translation.

我将会有一个很高的水平，因为要深入到每一个区域，我们可以持续几个小时。一些好的想法，一些领域的工作开始为会话率优化，其中之一是翻译。

If you have an international product that's not translated，  you should be thinking about that.

如果你有一个没有翻译的国际产品，你应该考虑一下。

That immediately drives more people to start using your  product. The second thing is authentication. Most of your products probably have some idea of  user accounts where you can sign up to your product and you can come back  and log into your product. You'd be surprised how much， how hard this is. From  Airbnb， I know we spent many years working on just authentication. Signing up and logging  in.

这会立刻促使更多的人开始使用你的产品。第二件事是认证。您的大多数产品可能都有一些用户帐户的想法，在那里您可以注册您的产品，您可以回来，并登录到您的产品。你会很惊讶这有多难。来自AIRBNB，我知道我们花了很多年的时间在认证上。注册并登录。

It sounds so simple， but it turns out that's a very fragile moment of  users sort of like flowing through your product， but you can always continue to make  optimizations.

听起来很简单，但事实证明，这是一个用户非常脆弱的时刻，就像在你的产品中流动一样，但你可以继续进行优化。

If you go to Airbnb and you go to Pinterest today， assume that whatever  is there in terms of authentication is the most optimized version. These companies spend enormous  amount of time optimizing signup conversion. Another big area of for conversion rate optimization is  onboarding. So when I come to your product， what's the first thing I experience and  what can the product do to bring me towards the value of the product as  quickly as possible? Those are things that you work on when you're working on onboarding.  And then another big area here is purchase conversion， so sort of like when I'm  about to buy something， a product and actually can take the final decision around what  you do， there's so many things you can do here. All right. So then， there  is something called growth channels. So what is a growth channels? Growth channels is how  people discover your product. Now， when you're a small company， and I don't know how  big you guys are， but let's say you have less than 50 users. You shouldn't  really be thinking about growth channels. Even if you have less than 5，000 users， you  probably shouldn't be thinking about this because it's too early. But the things that you  do when you're small that don't scale have the word don't scale in it for  reason. They don't actually scale. There are very few companies who kind of grow big  without growing in one of these scalable growth channels. There are not that many platforms，  and the channel/platform can be used in the same way. There are not that many  things that are really， really big in the world on which you can build a  large company. Let's talk about what those channels are. The first thing here is basically  you think through the behavior of your product， and let's talk about the first one  here， which is， if the way I discover your product is a rare behavior， where  people use Google to find your solution. This is actually how very， a lot of  products in the world are being discovered.

如果你去AIRBNB，你现在去Pinterest，假设在身份验证方面有什么是最优化的版本。这些公司花费大量的时间优化注册转换。另一大领域的转换率优化是入职。那么，当我来到贵公司的产品面前，我所经历的第一件事是什么?产品能做些什么来使我尽快实现产品的价值? 这些都是你在入职工作时要做的事情。还有一个很大的领域是购买转换，所以就像当我准备购买一些东西，一个产品，实际上可以围绕你所做的事情做最后的决定一样，你可以在这里做很多事情。那好吧。因此，有一种叫做成长通道的东西。那么什么是增长渠道呢? 成长渠道是人们发现你的产品的方式。现在，当你是一个小公司，我不知道你们有多大，但让我们假设你有不到50个用户。你不应该真的考虑增长渠道。即使你的用户不到5000，你可能也不应该考虑这个问题，因为它太早了。但是，当你很小的时候，你所做的事情，如果没有规模的话，就不会因为理由而在其中进行规模扩张。他们并不是真正的规模。很少有公司没有在这些可扩展的增长渠道中成长壮大。没有那么多的平台，并且可以以同样的方式使用信道/平台。在这个世界上，没有那么多东西是真正的，真正的大的，你可以在这些东西上建立一个大公司。我们来谈谈那些频道是什么。这里的第一件事基本上是你仔细考虑你的产品的行为，让我们在这里讨论第一件事，如果我发现你的产品是一种罕见的行为，人们会使用谷歌来找到你的解决方案。这实际上是世界上很多产品被发现的程度。

If you have something through which to answer  the question around what you do， once a year， you go to Google， probably if  you're building a company trying to answer the question， you should be on Google. A  good example here might be buying a house. You aren't buying a house more than  once a twice in your entire house， which means when you go and buy a  house， you're probably going to go to Google， which is not surprisingly that something like  Zillow or Redfin or all those different sites that allow you to buy homes online  are entirely optimized for SEO and sometimes paid search.

如果你有什么东西可以回答你的问题，每年一次，你去谷歌，也许如果你正在建立一个公司试图回答这个问题，你应该在谷歌上。这里的一个很好的例子就是买房子。在你的整个房子里，你买房子的次数不超过一次两次，这意味着当你去买房子的时候，你可能会去谷歌，这并不奇怪，像Zillow或Redfin之类的东西，或者所有允许你在网上买房子的网站，都是针对搜索引擎优化的，有时是付费搜索。

If you are using something every  day， you're not going to go back to Google every day. You're going to go  to straight to that product. You're going to open the app on your phone. You're  going to go to the straight to the website， whatever it might be. You're not  going to go to Google anymore， just to kind of figure out which of the  different things I'm going to use. Now， Google is not the only search engine. There  are other search engine that you can optimize for as well， but Google is the  one this all matters. Next behavior. Do people of my product already share the product  using word of mouth? If that's the case， then there are lots of things you  can do around virality and referrals. You can grow your product by accelerating that behavior  from existing users. You can either incentivize them with referrals where you're getting paid or  you can do it for free with using virality techniques. Does having more users of  my product actually improve my experience? So what do I mean by that? Well， if  I am building the next LinkedIn， it makes sense the product is not as valuable  when it's just all of us on LinkedIn but when it's a bunch more people  and companies on LinkedIn， it makes sense that the value kind of increases. Well， in  that sense， you should absolutely continue to do virality because every single user is sort  of an opportunity to bring in more users. Here's another way to think about virality.  And then， this is the common question I ask companies in sort of the early  days of YC: can you make a list， literally a spreadsheet， of all the people  in the world that would use my product? Let's say I sell to buyers who  decides to ... Doctor's offices， sell to doctor's offices. Well， I can probably make a  list of all the doctor's offices in the United States or in California.

如果你每天都在使用一些东西，你不会每天都回到谷歌。你将直接进入那个产品。你要打开手机上的应用程序。你要直接去网站，不管它是什么。你不会再去谷歌了，只是想弄清楚我要用哪些不同的东西。现在，谷歌并不是唯一的搜索引擎。还有其他的搜索引擎，你可以优化，以及，但谷歌是一个这一切的问题。下一个行为。我的产品的人已经用口口相传分享产品了吗? 如果是这样的话，那么在病毒和推荐方面你可以做很多事情。您可以通过加速现有用户的行为来扩展产品。你既可以在你得到报酬的地方通过推荐来激励他们，也可以通过使用病毒技术免费这样做。有更多的用户使用我的产品真的能提高我的经验吗? 那我这是什么意思? 嗯，如果我正在打造下一个LinkedIn，那么当LinkedIn上只有我们所有人的时候，这个产品的价值并不是那么高，但是当LinkedIn上有一群更多的人和更多的公司的时候，这个产品的价值就会增加，这是很有意义的。嗯，从这个意义上说，你绝对应该继续使用病毒，因为每个用户都有机会引入更多的用户。这里有另一种方式来思考病毒。然后，在YC的早期，这是我问公司的一个常见问题:你能为世界上所有使用我的产品的人做一个电子表格吗? 假设我卖给买家谁决定。。。医生的办公室，出售给医生的办公室。嗯，我可能会列出美国或加州所有的医生办公室。

It wouldn't  be that hard.

不会那么难的。

It's totally possible. So I would find a way to make that  list and then would go out and do sales. This is surprisingly something， often， something  that you should start with.

完全有可能。所以我会想办法列一张清单，然后出去做销售。这是令人惊讶的事情，经常，一些你应该开始的事情。

If you can make the list， if you know who  those people are， you should do go and do sales. The last one here is  does my users have high LTV? Do I charge enough for my product for it  to be valuable? Well， then I should definitely go and do， pay the acquisition for  example， Google and Facebook.

如果你能列清单，如果你知道那些人是谁，你应该去做销售。最后一个是我的用户有高LTV吗? 我对我的产品是否收取足够的费用以使它有价值? 好吧，那么我肯定应该去做，支付收购，例如谷歌和Facebook。

I shouldn't do acquisitions or paid ads unless I actually am  charging for my product. All right.

我不应该做收购或付费广告，除非我真的对我的产品收费。那好吧。

I'm going to go through each one of these.  It's not going to be possible to go into super deep detail for all of  them， but I'm going to go into， a little bit deeper into some of them  and not the others. All right. Let's talk about referrals. So I worked on the  referral program at Airbnb for a very long time. The way to think about referrals  is sort of a engineered word of month. So if people are already talking about  your product， referrals is a way through which you can engineer more people talking about  your product. One way could be just making it easier. Another way could be by  using financial incentives. So in the Airbnb referral program， we had a financial incentive where  as a referrer， I would make $20 for every users I would sign up in  travel credit， and as a referee， I would get $40 as a new user of  Airbnb in travel credits. We would kind of start with that principle and then try  to get as many people what we call through our referral funnels as possible. You  notice I used the word funnel here again. Every product is a funnel. Even the  referral product， which is a sort of a product of itself， inside Airbnb， had its  own funnel.

我要检查每一个。这是不可能的，进入超级深入的细节，为他们所有，但我将进入，一些更深入的一部分，而不是其他的。那好吧。我们来谈谈推荐吧。所以我在Airbnb工作了很长一段时间。考虑推荐的方法是一个设计好的月词。因此，如果人们已经在谈论你的产品，推荐是一种方法，你可以通过它来设计更多的人谈论你的产品。一种方法就是让事情变得简单。另一种方法可能是使用财政奖励。因此，在Airbnb推荐项目中，我们有一个财务奖励，作为推荐人，我将为每一个在旅行信贷中注册的用户挣20美元，作为一名仲裁人，我将作为Airbnb的一个新用户获得40美元的旅行积分。我们会从这个原则开始，然后试图通过我们的推荐渠道让尽可能多的人得到我们所称的东西。你注意到我又用了漏斗这个词。每种产品都是漏斗。即使是推荐产品，它本身也是一种产品，在Airbnb内部，也有它自己的漏斗。

I'm not going to go through all of these details， but the way  you think about something that's kind of engineering and product-led is that you break it  down into different steps， and then you measure every single one of these steps， and  then you kind of measure the conversion rate to the very end. The first step  here is weekly active users that saw the referral program. So how many users saw  the referral program? If I wasn't measuring this step， I wouldn't know how many people  did that. When we started measuring this step， and I've seen this with many other  companies who have a referral program， is that a small percentage of your active users  see the referral program. Well， how could you be expected to use it if you  can't see it? We started measuring this in the early days of Airbnb. Turns out  that there's a lot of opportunity of just telling people about you having a referral  program， but then there's all these opportunities to optimize through that funnel. There is people  sending invites， how many they send to， the conversion rate to new users， to new  guest， and finally to them booking their first 10 nights. Here's another display. This slide  is going to be available online afterwards， so you don't have to take notes or  photos. We kind of separate the funnel into even more detail， and we would continue  to optimize this for years. Like thus all matters a lot， and we would continue  to optimize for years.

我并不打算详细介绍这些细节，但是您对某种工程和产品主导的东西的思考方式是，将其分解为不同的步骤，然后对这些步骤中的每一个进行测量，然后对转换率进行测量，直到最后一步。这里的第一步是每周查看推荐方案的活动用户。那么有多少用户看过这个推荐程序呢? 如果我不是在测量这一步，我不知道有多少人做到了。当我们开始测量这一步时，我在许多其他有推荐程序的公司中看到了这一点，你的活跃用户中有一小部分人看到了推荐程序。那么，如果你看不见它，你怎么能指望使用它呢? 我们在Airbnb的早期就开始测量这个。原来，有很多机会，只是告诉人们你有一个推荐程序，但然后有所有这些机会通过漏斗优化。有的人发送邀请，他们发送多少，转换率向新用户，新客人，最后向他们预订他们的前10个晚上。这是另一个展览。这张幻灯片将在网上提供之后，所以你不必做笔记或拍照。我们把漏斗分成更多的细节，我们将继续优化这几年。就像这样，一切都很重要，我们将继续优化多年。

I'm going to go through one example of sort of like  one of those conversion rate optimizations we did for the referral program. So here is  their referral invite email.

我将通过一个类似于我们为推荐程序所做的转换率优化的例子。这是他们的推荐邀请邮件。

If someone else， if I invited someone ... One of you  guys， you would get one of these emails. The email would say， "Gustaf Alströmer invited  you to Airbnb. Gustaf sent you $40 on your first trip on Airbnb. You can  book a room， small loft. Just sign up by 25th of May， 2018，" and then  there's a button they call "Accept invitation，" and then there's a photo of me and  my name. Looks pretty good. Now， this email is result of dozens of experiments. Nothing  here is random. Everything here is for reason. Let's talk about that. The first one  is the subject line. The subject line has my name.

如果别人，如果我邀请别人。。。你们中的一个，你会收到一封邮件。邮件中会说:“古斯塔夫·阿尔斯特罗默邀请你去Airbnb。古斯塔夫第一次去Airbnb时给你寄去了40美元。你可以预订一个小阁楼，在2018年5月25日前注册。”然后还有一个按钮，他们叫“接受邀请”，然后还有一张我和我的名字的照片。看起来不错。现在，这封邮件是几十个实验的结果。这里没有什么是偶然的。这里的一切都是有道理的。我们来谈谈吧。第一条是主题线。这一行是我的名字。

If it's sent to any  of my friends， that make them more likely to open it. The headline of the  email have a clear value.

如果它被送到我的朋友那里，他们就更有可能打开它。邮件标题有明确的价值。

It's very， very clear what this email is about. You'd  be surprised how many emails that don't have a clear headline and a clear of  value of what the email is about. This email is about that I sent you  $40 on your first trip on this website called Airbnb. This， which is "Sign up  by May 25th， 2018" is urgency. You should sign up by May 25th， 2018.

非常非常清楚这封邮件是关于什么的。你会惊讶地发现，有多少封邮件没有清楚的标题，也没有清楚的邮件的价值。这封邮件是关于我在你的第一次旅行时给你寄了40美元，这个网站叫airbnb。这是“在2018年5月25日前签约”的当务之急。你应该在2018年5月25日前报名。

That's  the urgency that makes you actually go， that increases the chance of people who see  this email actually go and do it. The name here， "Accept invitation，" it a sense  of exclusivity.

这就是让你真正离开的紧迫性，这增加了看到这封邮件的人真正离开并完成它的机会。这里的名字，“接受邀请”，是一种排外的感觉。

It doesn't say "Sign up" for a reason. Because sign up， anyone can  sign up. By accepting an invitation sends an idea of exclusivity. Finally， it has my  name， where I live， and how long I've been a user of Airbnb with my  photo.

它没有说“注册”是有原因的。因为报名，任何人都可以报名。通过接受邀请，就会产生一种排他性的想法。最后，它有我的名字，我住的地方，和我的照片，我已经是一个用户的Airbnb多久了。

That's really strong social proof that I endorsed this website.

这是我认可这个网站的有力的社会证明。

I endorsed this product.  The way you think about this is sort of how you think about all of  conversation rate optimization.

我认可了这个产品。你思考这个问题的方式就像你思考所有会话速率优化问题的方式一样。

It's a set of optimizations. Pay growth. This is one of the  areas I'm not going too deep into the [inaudible] here. The things that matter for  pay growth is that you shouldn't do it unless you have revenue. Too many companies  are buying ads when they don't have any revenue or know how they're going to  make any revenue.

这是一组优化。工资增长。这是我不想深入[听不见的]这里的一个领域。对于工资增长来说，重要的是，除非你有收入，否则你不应该这么做。太多的公司购买广告时，他们没有任何收入或知道他们将如何赚取任何收入。

That's a big mistake. You shouldn't be doing that.

这是个大错误。你不该这么做。

If you have  revenue， there's a couple of concepts that really matter. The first one: how much money  am I paying for each new users that I'm acquiring? It's called customer acquisition cost  or CAC.

如果你有收入，有几个概念才是真正重要的。第一个问题:我要为每一个新用户支付多少钱? 这叫做客户收购成本或CAC。

What's lifetime value or payback time of the users that I have acquired  through pay growth? What that means is: what's the longest that I can， with some  level of accuracy， forecast how much these users will be worth? If a user is  paying $10 per month， and then we can have this cohort analysis that we had  in the beginning [inaudible] retention， we can figure out exactly how much our user's going  to be worth.

我通过薪酬增长获得的用户的终身价值或回报时间是多少? 这意味着:在某种程度上，我能预测这些用户的价值，最长的时间是多少? 如果一个用户每月支付10美元，然后我们就可以进行这个队列分析，就可以确切地计算出我们的用户将会有多大的价值。

If my customer acquisition cost is lower than my lifetime value， then  that's good.

如果我的客户获得成本低于我的终身价值，那么这是好的。

That means you have a great payback time.

这意味着你有一个伟大的回报时间。

If you only pay $20  for a user， that means if you make $10 per month， you have probably around  two months payback time.

如果你只为一个用户支付20美元，这意味着如果你每月挣10美元，你可能有大约两个月的时间来偿还。

It's more complicated than that， but it's sort of like a  simplified version. These are the most important concepts to keep in mind for pay growth.  Attribution. This matters if things get complicated.

它比这复杂得多，但它有点像一个简化的版本。这些都是工资增长最重要的概念。归因。如果事情变得复杂了，这很重要。

If using both Google and Facebook， if you  get into some level of scale， you need to understand what it means to attribute  a new paid user to the dollar that you spent.

如果你同时使用谷歌和Facebook，如果你达到某种程度的规模，你需要理解将一个新的付费用户归因于你所花的钱意味着什么。

I'm not going to go  too much into detail what this means， but this is something that you should learn  if you're spending time on pay growth. Finally， in my opinion， there are only four  channels to manage that scale: Facebook， Instagram， Google and YouTube. These are the very， very  large pay growth channels through which many companies are actually built on these days. One  of the unspoken truth in my opinion is that a lot of the free channels  of growth is going down， and the pay channels are going up. A good example  of that is that it's hard to grow on the Facebook newsfeed unless you're paying  Facebook money. Same is true for Instagram.

这意味着什么，我不会说得太多，但是如果你在工资增长上花时间的话，这是你应该学习的。最后，在我看来，只有四个渠道来管理这个规模:Facebook，Instagram，谷歌和YouTube。这些都是很多公司实际上建立的非常非常庞大的薪酬增长渠道。在我看来，一个不为人知的事实是，许多自由增长渠道正在下降，而薪酬渠道正在上升。这方面的一个很好的例子是，除非你支付Facebook的钱，否则很难在Facebook NewsFeed上成长。Instagram也是如此。

It's sort of changing always. When there's a  new platform， they often kind of promote free users in the beginning， and then they  start to monetize that.

总是在变。当有了一个新的平台，他们通常会在一开始就提倡免费的用户，然后他们开始将其货币化。

That's sort of what's happening for both Facebook， Google， and Instagram  today. All right. Search engine optimization. Search engine optimization or SEO. Some people might say  well， this is something of the past.

这就是Facebook，谷歌和Instagram今天所发生的事情。那好吧。搜索引擎优化。搜索引擎优化或搜索引擎优化。有些人可能会说，这是过去的事。

In my experience， it is not.

以我的经验，这不是。

It still  matters because as long as we go back to Google to make our decisions about  what we're going to do in the future， this matters. Google is probably one of  the largest websites in the world.

这仍然很重要，因为只要我们回到谷歌，决定我们将来要做什么，这很重要。谷歌可能是世界上最大的网站之一。

It's a big deal. The one thing you should  know about SEO is that there's a difference between what you see on a website  and what Google see. Google can't view images. Google can't view JavaScript very easily.

这是件大事。关于搜索引擎优化，你应该知道的一件事是，你在网站上看到的和谷歌看到的有区别。谷歌无法查看图片。谷歌不太容易查看JavaScript。

If  you go to Airbnb and you see all of this， just remember that Google can't  see this. So if you're trying to communicate to someone who's searching for Stockholm on  Google or apartments in Stockholm， this is not what going to be delivered back to  Google. Google is going to see a bunch of lines of text that which you  had marked out in your code， and that Google have hopefully indexed， if you've done  the right thing.

如果你去Airbnb，你会看到所有这些，只要记住谷歌不能看到这些。因此，如果你试图与在谷歌或斯德哥尔摩公寓中搜索斯德哥尔摩的人沟通，那么这不是你要送回给谷歌的东西。如果你做了正确的事情，谷歌将会看到一大堆你在代码中标记出来的文字，如果你做了正确的事情，谷歌希望能把这些文字编入索引。

And if you haven't， then it's going to like your fault. So  there are a bunch of basics that you can do with SEO， you just have  to get right. The easiest thing you can do is to run your website through  an SEO browser and try to figure out if you only saw this， would you  understand what your product is about? So using clear language， not in JavaScript to describe  what your product does is the most basic things you can do for SEO. There's  two different areas of optimization for SEO. This is as high level as it gets.  At Airbnb， there's a team of 20 people working on this of which 12 or  13 are engineers. This is a really， really big deal， but this is sort of  at the high level. There's two types of optimizations for SEO. There are things that  you can change on your website， and there are other people in the world that  link into your websites. This is the two main leverage that you have on SEO.  For the on-page optimization， the right way to start is not to start with like，  "Oh， let's make some changes." The right way to start is with a strategy.

如果你没有，那么它会喜欢你的错。因此，有一堆基本的，你可以做的搜索引擎优化，你只需要得到正确的。你能做的最简单的事情是运行你的网站通过一个搜索引擎优化浏览器，并试图弄清楚，如果你只看到这一点，你会理解你的产品是关于什么的? 因此，使用清晰的语言，而不是使用JavaScript来描述您的产品所做的是您可以为SEO做的最基本的事情。SEO有两个不同的优化领域。这是一个很高的水平，因为它得到。在Airbnb，有一个由20人组成的团队，其中12人或13人是工程师。这是一个真的，真的很重要的事情，但这是在某种程度上是高水平的。SEO有两种优化类型。有些东西你可以在你的网站上改变，世界上还有其他人可以链接到你的网站。这是两个主要杠杆，你有搜索引擎优化。对于页面上的优化，正确的开始方法不是从“哦，让我们做一些改变”开始。正确的方法是从一个策略开始。

What  am I trying to rank for? What key words exist on Google today that I  might want to be the number one result for? Now， to do that， you have  to do what's called a keyword analysis or a keyword research. You have to try  to figure out what are all the things that people are searching for that might  relate to my product? And then hopefully， they have some amount of large volume that  they're searching for， and then I can try to say well， these keywords that have  a medium to high volume and they're not that much competition around these keywords， those  are the ones I want to rank for. When you decided that， the other areas  around page optimizations now are easier because now you know what you're trying to rank  for. At scale， but I've seen this at small scale too， SEO at this point  is about SEO experimentation， which means you can do the set of best practices in  SEO.

我要排名是为了什么? 今天在谷歌上存在哪些关键词，我想成为第一个关键词呢? 现在，要做到这一点，您必须执行所谓的关键字分析或关键字研究。你必须试着弄清楚，人们正在寻找的与我的产品有关的所有东西是什么? 然后希望，他们有一些大的体积，他们正在搜索，然后我可以尝试说，这些关键字，有一个中等到高的体积，他们没有太多的竞争围绕这些关键字，这些是我想要排名。当您决定这样做时，页面优化的其他方面现在变得更容易了，因为现在您知道了自己想要排名什么了。在Scale，但我也看到过这一点在小规模，搜索引擎优化在这一点上是关于搜索引擎优化实验，这意味着你可以在搜索引擎优化的最佳实践集。

It might take you to be a decent size company. But if you want  to become a massive company， a really， really large company who's growing through SEO， you  have to use experimentation to make those decisions. The other thing that matter here is  off-page optimization: who's linking to you. There are lots of tools you can use to  figure out who are all the websites online that links to you.

你可能需要成为一个规模不错的公司。但是，如果你想成为一个大公司，一个真正的，真正的大公司谁正在通过搜索引擎优化成长，你必须使用实验来作出这些决定。这里的另一个问题是页面外的优化:谁在链接你。有很多工具，你可以使用，以确定谁是所有的网站，网上链接到你。

What's their sort  of domain， authority? Are they actually authoritative on the web to have something that's ...  There's a huge difference if I would link to your website or if The New  York Times link to your website.

他们的领域，权力是什么? 他们真的在网上有权威的东西，如果我链接到你的网站，或者纽约时报链接到你的网站，那会有很大的不同。

It matters a lot in how， in Google's perception  of your site. One surprising way that Airbnb is that we had a lot of  press， a lot of people in the world for media would come and write about  Airbnb.

在谷歌如何看待你的网站时，这一点非常重要。Airbnb的一个令人惊讶的方式是，我们有很多媒体，世界上很多媒体的人会来报道Airbnb。

That was surprisingly important for our off-page optimizations.

这对于我们的页面外优化非常重要。

If you have people writing about  you， either in press or in other areas， that's actually a great thing.

如果你让别人在报纸上或其他地方写你的文章，那其实是件好事。

If you  don't have anyone writing about you， well， you're not going to have that many links  because the web have changed. There aren't that may links anymore.

如果你没有人写你，那么，你不会有那么多的链接，因为网络已经改变了。可能已经没有联系了。

It's not like everyone  have a website these days that are linking to each together. These are things have  changed. You have to be strategic about who are you getting links from. The easiest  way you can do is whenever you get written up by anyone， press or whatever，  just ask them to link to you.

这不是说现在每个人都有一个链接到一起的网站。这些东西都变了。你必须对从谁那里获取链接保持战略态度。你能做的最简单的方法就是，当你被任何人，媒体或其他任何东西写下来的时候，只要让他们链接到你就行了。

It matters to you. The last thing I  want to talk about here is on growth teams. A growth team today is typically  engineers， data scientists， designers， product managers， end user researchers. These are not all the people  that you might have in your company today， but these are the companies that you'll  have when you start making decisions around growth. The way you organize a growth team  is there's sort of two options. You either have the growth team as its own  team and the rest of the product is the product team. The challenge here is  that when you're a small company and you're not kind of like somewhat ignorant about  growth， what [inaudible] often say like， "I've hired a growth engineer.

对你来说很重要。我最不想谈的就是成长团队。当今的成长团队通常是工程师，数据科学家，设计师，产品经理，最终用户研究人员。这些人并不是你今天在公司里可能拥有的所有人，但当你开始围绕成长做出决定时，这些人就是你将拥有的公司。组织成长团队的方式有两种选择。您或者拥有成长团队作为自己的团队，而产品的其他部分就是产品团队。这里的挑战是，当你是一个小公司，而你并不是有点不知道增长，什么[听不到的]经常说，“我已经聘请了一个增长工程师。

I hired growth product  manager.

我聘请了增长产品经理。

That person is going to be doing all the growth in the company." That's  sort of not really a recipe for success.

他说:“这并不是一个成功的秘诀。

It's kind of a fine balance between  saying everyone is responsible for growth， which doesn't work and having a small team that  is responsible for all the growth. You kind of have to find a balance here.  The right way to find that balance is to set very clear goals and very  clear dividing lines in your product. A good example here might be everyone that works  in the core product， which is sort of the value of your product ... Let's  say I am Gusto， the ... Running payroll for employees is the core product. Now，  everyone trying to get to that experience that sort of like the growth area of  Gusto. So that would be one easy way to make distinction between growth and product.  How do you decide what to work on? You make a simple calculation of what's  the effort， what's the minimal viable thing I want to try here， and sort of  how big of an outcome can that be? Always try to forecast out the outcomes  before you actually start doing the work because if you're forecasting something and at best  case scenario， it's small， you shouldn't be doing it， even though it's a low effort.  All right.

这是一种很好的平衡，既要说每个人都对成长负责，这是不起作用的，也要说有一个小团队来负责所有的成长。你得在这里找到平衡。找到平衡的正确方法是在您的产品中设置非常明确的目标和非常明确的分界线。这里的一个很好的例子可能是每个在核心产品中工作的人，这就是你的产品的价值。。。让我们假设我很喜欢，为员工运行工资单是核心产品。现在，每个人都试图获得那种体验，就像增长领域的乐趣。因此，这将是区分增长和产品的一种简单方法。你如何决定要做什么? 你简单地计算一下，我想在这里尝试的最小可行的事情是什么，以及结果会有多大? 在实际开始工作之前，总是要尝试预测结果，因为如果你在预测某件事，最好的情况是，它是很小的，你不应该这样做，即使它是一个低努力。那好吧。

I have two small short sections left of this talk. The first one  is called making decisions.

我还有两小段话要讲。第一种叫做做决定。

If you ask any product manager at Airbnb today， "What is  the most important tool or learning that you learned at Airbnb that you'll apply to  your next thing?" they will say experiment or experiment framework or some way of making  A/B test inside the company.

如果你今天问Airbnb的任何一位产品经理，“你在Airbnb学到的下一件事是什么，最重要的工具是什么?” 他们会说实验或者实验框架，或者公司内部做A/B测试的某种方法。

I'm so happy that Suhali is talking later because I  stole a quote from his investor deck that I found online. This is the quote:  most of the world will make decisions by either guessing or using the gut. They  will either be lucky or wrong.

我很高兴Suhali稍后会发言，因为我从他的投资平台上偷了一份我在网上找到的报价。这是一句名言:世界上大多数人要么猜测，要么利用直觉来做决定。他们要么是幸运的，要么是错误的。

If you keep making decisions without using data and  experimentation， you will be lucky or wrong. This is a huge problem.

如果你坚持不使用数据和实验来做决定，你将是幸运的还是错误的。这是个大问题。

If you kind  of get to a scale of Airbnb or something even smaller than that， then every  decision you're going to make that you don't use A/B testing for， you won't actually  know what the full， true outcome of that decision might be. At Airbnb， we use  experimentation and A?B testing for every single major decision in the entire company. This is  how that tool worked at Airbnb.

如果您某种程度上达到了airbnb或更小的规模，那么您将要做出的，不使用A/B测试的每一个决定，您实际上不会知道该决定的完整，真正的结果可能是什么。在Airbnb，我们对整个公司的每一个重大决策都使用实验和A?B测试。这就是该工具在airbnb中的工作原理。

I'm going to talk sort of like more about  how that looked like. Let's say in your company， you decide to ship a feature.  This is how many measurements of that metric per day and the Wednesday here is  when I ship them in the future. They'll look at it two weeks later， and  it looks at that， the metric of that feature went up， so it's a good  thing， right? Well， it's not that easy because there are so many more different factors.  Who knows what happened between here? If you're a soccer app and the World Cup  just started， well， then， you wouldn't know if the features had made a difference.

我要说的更多一些是关于这是什么样子的。假设在你的公司，你决定推出一个功能。这是一天多少度量值，星期三是我将来装运它们的时候。两周后，他们会看它，看它，这个特性的度量值上升了，所以这是件好事，对吧? 这并不容易，因为有很多不同的因素。谁知道这之间发生了什么? 如果你是一个足球应用程序，而世界杯才刚刚开始，那么，你就不知道这些功能是否起了作用。

If  this was just peak season of whatever you're doing， this is a school app， education  app， and this is September， then you wouldn't know either. So the only way you  would know is what's called a counterfactual. Basically an A/B test. By running two different  versions of the same feature， the same site， the same time， you would be able  to know what the true difference between making this decisions and not making it was.  This might sounds a bit technical， but it's very， very important to internalize because you  will get to a point where you were successful up until that point and you  think that you are so good at making these decisions， and then they get harder  to make. You have to have a framework to make these decisions. Because this is  so important at Airbnb， we built something we call experiminterview. Experiminterview is when the whole  growth team would meet in a room like this， would go through all the features  that we had recently built， and before we told you which of the different features  in the experiment that actually won， we'd ask the audience. So I'm going to do  that with you guys here. Here's a photo of a experiminterview. We would do this  every two or three weeks.

如果这只是你正在做的事情的高峰期，这是一个学校应用程序，教育应用程序，而这是九月，那么你也不会知道。所以你要知道的唯一方法就是所谓的反事实。基本上是A/B测试。通过运行同一功能的两个不同版本，同一站点，同一时间，您将能够了解做出此决定与不做出此决定之间的真正区别。这听起来可能有点技术性，但这是非常非常重要的内部化，因为你会达到一个点，你是成功的，直到这一点，你认为你是如此擅长作出这些决定，然后他们变得难以作出。你必须有一个框架来做出这些决定。因为这在Airbnb非常重要，所以我们建立了一种叫做实验访谈的东西。实验面试是指当整个成长团队在这样一个房间里开会的时候，我们会检查一下我们最近构建的所有功能，在我们告诉你在实验中哪些不同的功能真正获得了胜利之前，我们会问观众。所以我要和你们一起去。这是一张实验采访的照片。我们会每两三个星期做一次。

It's really fun. But it drove home this one thing，  which is that making product decisions are really hard. All right. Let's get started. The  goal of this product was to increase the number of shares from the Airbnb mobile  app， specifically the number of shares of listings. Back at that time， we had two  options. We had the native share sheet that you'll know about， and then we have  this experiment share sheet， which take up the entire screen and has more colors. The  same type of buttons， sort of. You can see the difference here. Now， before I  show the answer， how many here think that the native share sheet led to more  shares? Raise your hand.

真的很有趣。但这让我明白了一件事，那就是做产品决策真的很困难。那好吧。我们开始吧。该产品的目标是增加Airbnb Mobile应用程序的股票数量，特别是上市股票的数量。当时，我们有两个选择。我们有你会知道的本地共享表，然后我们有这个实验共享表，它占据了整个屏幕，并且有更多的颜色。同样类型的按钮，有点。你可以看到这里的区别。现在，在我给出答案之前，有多少人认为本地股票单导致了更多的股票? 举起手来。

It's about half the room. How many here thought that the  new share sheet that one of our engineers built drove more shares? Raise your hand.  So many hands did not raise.

差不多有一半的房间。这里有多少人认为，我们的一位工程师建造的新股票推动了更多的股票? 举起手来。这么多人没有举起手。

I'm assuming you guys think there was no difference.  Because this is so hard， you have to make a decision. You have to make  a decision. You have to have an opinion.

我猜你们觉得没什么区别。因为这太难了，你得做个决定。你得做个决定。你得有自己的意见。

If you don't have an opinion here，  you're basically saying， "I can't decide，" so. This share sheet led to 40% more shares.  It's very important in this case that we use experimentation because if we had just  gone by our gut， we would've been wrong. Half of the room， more than half  of the room would've been wrong. Let's do one more. So we sent out this  email to existing users of Airbnb to sort of ... When I would make a  booking at Airbnb， we sent out this email to the people that I listed as  my co-travelers， and the email will look in the control like this， where it would  have the itinerary， the address to that listing， and the button on that email would  say， "Join Gustaf's trip." Now we tried a new version where the email looked a  little bit different， less content， and then we have a different button here called "Accept  Gustaf's trip invitation." The goal here was to get signups， so people have to click  on this button， and then sign up. How many here think that "Join Gustaf's trip"  in the control led to more signups? Raise your hand. Some people. How many here  think that "Accept Gustaf's trip invitation"? Raise your hand.

如果你在这里没有意见，你基本上是在说，“我不能决定”，所以。这张股票单导致了40%以上的股票。在这种情况下，使用实验是非常重要的，因为如果我们按照自己的直觉去做，我们就错了。一半的房间，超过一半的房间都错了。再来一次。因此，我们将这封邮件发送给airbnb的现有用户。。。当我在airbnb预订时，我们将把这封邮件发送给我列出为我的共同旅行者的人，而这封邮件将像这样显示在控件中，在那里它将有行程，该列表的地址，以及该邮件上的按钮会说，“加入gustaf的旅行”。现在我们尝试了一个新的版本，邮件看起来有点不同，内容少了，然后我们在这里有一个不同的按钮，称为“接受古斯塔夫的旅行邀请。” 这里的目标是获得签名，所以人们必须点击这个按钮，然后注册。这里有多少人认为“加入古斯塔夫之旅”会导致更多的信号? 举起手来。有些人。有多少人认为“接受古斯塔夫的旅行邀请”? 举起手来。

That's good. How many here think  that there was no difference? So this is a 14% increase of just changing the，  basically name of the button. Let's try one more for simplicity.

很好。这里有多少人认为没有区别? 因此，这是一个14%的增加，只是改变，基本上名称的按钮。为了简单起见，让我们再试一个。

In this case， now  they're sharing experiments.

在这种情况下，现在他们正在分享实验。

I'm kind of giving you the very easy-to-understand ones. The control here  was sort of like a bunch of sharing options on the Airbnb listing. We had  some Twitter icons， the Facebook icons， the email icons. We had another version of that，  which the icons were round.

我给你一个很容易理解的答案。这里的控件有点像airbnb列表中的一堆共享选项。我们有一些Twitter图标，Facebook图标，电子邮件图标。我们有另外一个版本，图标是圆形的。

And then we have one that was called， sort of  square buttons， and it was just displaying email and Facebook， and then they can click  on more. How many here thought， if the goal was sharing ，that the control with  the icons won? Raise your hand. Some people. How many here thought that the round  buttons were better? Raise your hand. Some people. How many thought the square buttons? Wow.  You guys are really good. How many thought there was no difference? Well， both of  these were winners. This was， by far， the biggest winner. These are the kind of  things that we debated， and because we run experiments， you don't have to debate anymore.  Product decisions are really hard. At scale， you want to use experimentation， A/B testing to  make these decisions because otherwise， it'll be loudest voice in the room， they'll make decisions，  and you don't want that. To summary sort of my talk， if you're running a  startup， you should be thinking about growth. Before you start working on growth tactics， you  should be measuring your retention and knowing if people are using， repeatedly using your product.  You should pick a metric and then pick a goal for that metric and drive  that metric towards that goal. Very simple.

然后，我们有一个被称为，有点方形按钮，它只是显示电子邮件和Facebook，然后他们可以点击更多。这里有多少人认为，如果目标是共享的，那么带有图标的控件会赢? 举起手来。有些人。这里有多少人认为圆形按钮更好? 举起手来。有些人。有多少人认为是方形按钮? 哇哦。你们真的很棒。有多少人认为没有区别? 这两个都是赢家。到目前为止，这是最大的赢家。这些都是我们争论的问题，因为我们进行实验，你们不必再争论了。产品决定真的很难。在Scale中，您希望使用实验，A/B测试来做出这些决定，因为否则，这将是房间里最大声的声音，他们会做出决定，而您不希望这样。总结一下我的观点，如果你在经营一家初创公司，你应该考虑成长。在你开始研究成长策略之前，你应该先衡量你的保持能力，并知道人们是否在使用你的产品，是否在重复使用你的产品。您应该选择一个度量，然后为该度量选择一个目标，并将该度量驱动到该目标。很简单。

And then eventually， but not right away， you  should start running A/B tests for decisions that are hard to make.

然后最终，但不是马上，您应该开始运行A/B测试，以处理难以做出的决定。

In the early  days， decisions are not that hard to make because they might be obvious， but the  moment they're not easy anymore， you should be doing this with experimentation. Thank you.

在早期，决策并不是那么难做的，因为它们可能是显而易见的，但当它们不再容易的时候，你应该通过实验来做到这一点。谢谢你。

I  think we have time for a couple of questions. Yes.

我想我们有时间问几个问题。是啊。

Audience: You said that experimentation is important for SEO. Do you have any frameworks or ways  you would think about trying experiments beyond just doing something randomly and then testing it  with A/B testing?

观众:你说过实验对搜索引擎优化很重要。您是否有任何框架或方法，您会考虑尝试一些实验，而不仅仅是随意地做一些事情，然后用A/B测试来测试它?

Gustaf A.: So the question was around experimentation and SEO. How do you go about doing that?  When you run an on-page experiment， what you're trying to test is the amount of  organic traffic you get from Google and how your ranking shifts. Google actually are changing  the rankings all the time， so if you make a big change on your website，  on say half ... Let's say， let's call you have for Airbnb's case， listing pages  ... Sorry. Search results pages. So Stockholm， London， San Francisco， we [inaudible] one group， and  then you have New York， Paris， and Barcelona be another group. You would change the  content on the first group of pages， but not the others. Within not too long  of a time， you would see more or less traffic going to either of these  groups from Google. Sometimes， there's no difference， but if there is a difference， you'll see  more traffic.

古斯塔夫A:所以问题是关于实验和搜索引擎优化。你是怎么做到的? 当你运行一个页面上的实验时，你要测试的是你从谷歌获得的有机流量，以及你的排名是如何变化的。谷歌实际上一直在改变排名，所以如果你在你的网站上做了一个大的改变，比如说。。。让我们说，让我们打电话给你为Airbnb的案件，列出网页。。。抱歉。搜索结果页。因此，斯德哥尔摩，伦敦，旧金山，我们(听不见)一个集团，然后你有纽约，巴黎，巴塞罗那是另一个集团。您将更改第一组页面的内容，但不更改其他页面的内容。在不太长的一段时间内，你会看到或多或少的流量从谷歌到这两个群体的任何一个。有时，没有区别，但如果有区别，你会看到更多的交通。

I'll give you an idea of a very small change you could make.  Let's， for example， change the title tag from "Airbnb listings" to "The 25 Top Best  Listings in Barcelona." One of them is going to rank better because it's going to  be more inviting to click on， and then you run that experiment towards the search  engine， and then the search engine will kind of tell you which one is better  based on the amount of traffic on the search engine that you get. Yes.

我给你一个主意，你可以做一个很小的改变。例如，让我们将title标记从“airbnb列表”更改为“巴塞罗那最好的25个列表”。其中一个会排名更好，因为点击会更吸引人，然后你对搜索引擎进行实验，然后搜索引擎会根据你在搜索引擎上得到的流量来告诉你哪一个更好。是啊。

Audience: Let's say that we're totally bought in on the [inaudible] of A/B testing but are  very early-stage startup that like we don't have enough traffic. This is something that our  team debates is we want to A/B test， but it feels like it's not worth  the effort because the results would not be reliable. How do you， what guidance do  you have for navigating that transition?

观众:让我们说，我们完全接受了A/B测试(听不到)，但我们是非常早期的初创公司，就像我们没有足够的流量。这是我们团队争论的问题，我们希望进行A/B测试，但感觉不值得这样做，因为结果不可靠。你如何，你有什么指南来引导你的转变?

Gustaf A.: So the question was around A/B testing. How do I determine if it's right for  me when I'm really early? So A/B testing is a function of change， so you  can have a medium to small-size audience.

古斯塔夫A:所以问题在于A/B测试。当我真的很早的时候，我如何判断它是否适合我呢? 所以A/B测试是一个改变的函数，所以你可以有一个中小型的观众。

If the change is large enough， is actually  can be significant. The numbers can be significant. Now， what you can do is you  go do， you can go to Google and type in A/B testing calculator. There's a  form will pop up， and you can type in the metric that you have， and  then the change. You could see how big the change have to be for you  to be able to see a difference. Now， if you're really， really small， you probably  shouldn't be doing A/B testing at all， so I would do A/B testing when you  have like enough traffic that you can see a medium to small-size change within， say，  two or three weeks. So I'd say a small change would be a couple of  percent.

如果变化足够大，实际上是可以显著的。数字可能很重要。现在，你可以做的是，你可以去谷歌，输入A/B测试计算器。会弹出一个表单，您可以输入您所拥有的度量值，然后输入更改。你可以看到有多大的变化，使你能够看到一个差异。现在，如果你真的，真的很小，你可能根本就不应该做A/B测试，所以当你有足够的流量时，我会做A/B测试，这样你就可以在两三周内看到一个中等到微小的变化。所以我会说一个微小的变化是几%。

If you can see that in a couple of weeks， kind of like that's  sort of the level you could be at.

如果你能在几周内看到这一点，就好像这就是你可能达到的水平。

That's probably my general recommendation.

这可能是我的一般建议。

I've certainly  seen a lot of companies that are early， embracing A/B testing relatively early， and then  have that guide their decision-making.

我当然已经看到很多公司都很早就开始接受A/B测试，然后就可以指导他们的决策。

I don't think that's a bad idea because I think  that's much ...

我不认为这是个坏主意，因为我觉得这太。。。

It's better to start a little bit early than to start way  too late.

与其开始得太晚，不如早一点开始。

If those are the only two options. Of course， you start at the  right time. Yep.

如果这是唯一的两个选择。当然，你从正确的时间开始。是啊。

Audience: How [inaudible] see growth in maybe high-barrier entry markets like health insurance?

听众:(听不见的)如何看待健康保险等高壁垒进入市场的增长?

Gustaf A.: How do apply growth to high-barrier entry market like health insurance? So I think you  should separate the acceleration of your growth in that market and the market itself.

古斯塔夫A:如何将增长应用于健康保险这样的高壁垒进入市场? 所以我认为你应该把你在这个市场上的加速增长和市场本身分开。

If  it's hard to reach people， that means you have to probably try to reach a  lot more people before you actually get sort of a ...

如果很难接触到人，那就意味着你可能要尝试接触到更多的人，然后你才能真正得到一种。。。

If a high ...  Tell me what you mean by a high barrier.

如果一个高。。。告诉我你说的高障碍是什么意思。

Audience: Well， for example， there's a bit， with insurance， you have to do risk sharing， right?  And you have to have to a lot people [inaudible] in order for one person  to want to buy your product because it's kind of this [inaudible] but there's also  a pile of regulation and [inaudible] on top of it?

听众:嗯，例如，有一点，有了保险，你就必须承担风险，对吧? 为了让一个人买你的产品，你必须要有很多人(听不到)，因为这是一种(听不到)，但是还有一堆规则和(听不到)在上面?

Gustaf A.: Yeah， so if you have a risk and regulation involved， I don't think that the  principle of growth changes， but if you're purely growing through sales， for example， you can  apply a lot of automation and technology to how to do sales.

古斯塔夫A:是的，所以如果你涉及到风险和监管，我不认为增长的原则会改变，但是如果你纯粹是通过销售来增长，比如，你可以应用大量的自动化和技术来实现销售。

If I'm a  company and I'm selling to insurance buyers at startups， I might be starting by emailing  10 people.

如果我是一家公司，我在初创公司向保险买家推销产品，我可能会从给10个人发邮件开始。

In fact， I can email 100 people or 1，000 people with the same  type of level of ... The email itself is kind of viewed as personal and  as direct to that receiver as if I send one email that I just wrote  myself. There's certainly things that you can apply to your growth that allows you to  reach a lot more people. Now， growth doesn't solve any of their risk challenges at  all.

事实上，我可以给100个人或者1000个人发邮件，邮件本身就是个人的，直接发送给接收者，就像我刚给自己写了一封邮件一样。当然，有一些东西你可以应用于你的成长，让你接触到更多的人。现在，经济增长根本解决不了任何风险挑战。

It doesn't solve any kind of major market issues. Airbnb certainly had a lot  issues with legal challenges in different markets， and so the growth was disconnected from that.  That wasn't sort of our goal.

这并不能解决任何重大的市场问题。Airbnb当然在不同市场存在许多法律问题，因此增长与此脱节。那不是我们的目标。

If you're a startup that have those problems， I  don't think you should solve them ... Solving them and solving growth are two different  things. They are very different from each other. Growth is a way to accelerate you  getting to more health insurance buyers.

如果你是一个有这些问题的初创公司，我不认为你应该解决这些问题。。。解决这些问题和解决成长问题是两件不同的事情。他们彼此很不一样。成长是一种加速你购买更多健康保险的方式。

It doesn't actually say anything whether that's a good  thing or a bad thing. Yeah.

不管这是好事还是坏事，它都没有说什么。是啊。

Audience: Do you have any wisdom on using non-sustainable tactics [inaudible] market like Uber?

观众:你有没有任何智慧使用不可持续的策略[不可听到的]市场，如Uber?

Gustaf A.: Do I have any wisdom of using non-sustainable tactics in new market like Uber? So  if you're doing things that don't scale， you sort of have two options. One is  they don't scale， so you should stop doing them eventually. Or you build a playbook  where you take those skills and kind of try them in a different city. Now，  they might not eventually scale， so let's say I am out manually to recruit Uber  drivers. Now that might be an unsustainable growth tactic.

古斯塔夫A:我是否有智慧在像Uber这样的新市场使用不可持续的策略? 所以，如果你做的事情规模不大，你有两个选择。一个是他们不扩展，所以你应该停止做他们最终。或者，你建立一个剧本，在那里，你采取这些技能，并尝试他们在一个不同的城市。现在，他们可能不会最终规模，所以让我们假设，我出来招募Uber司机手动。现在，这可能是一种不可持续的增长策略。

It might be working for the  first 20 drivers， but eventually， it's not going to have high ROI in comparison to  say running ads on Facebook to recruit drivers.

它可能为前20名司机工作，但最终，它不会有很高的ROI，相比而言，在Facebook上运行广告招聘司机。

I think you kind of have to  determine this manual thing that I'm doing in the very beginning， which is doing things  that don't scale， which is recruiting every single user to become a user of your  product， eventually won't work anymore， and you kind of have to find another channel， or  it won't be high ROI in comparison to the other channels. Most companies will go  through this transition period where you grow from， say， writing content manually to through engineering，  changing your website so that you get more search traffic， for example.

我认为您必须确定我在一开始所做的手动操作，即做的事情不是可扩展的，而是招募每个用户成为您产品的用户，最终将不再有效，而且您还需要找到另一个频道，否则与其他频道相比，它的ROI不会很高。例如，大多数公司都将经历这样一个过渡期:从手工编写内容发展到通过工程修改网站，这样你就可以获得更多的搜索流量。

Audience: What about how they're doing lots of subsidies for rides?

观众:那他们是如何为骑乘提供大量补贴的呢?

Gustaf A.: What about doing subsidies or incentives for rides? Well， I actually think the incentives are  super scalable. Like at Airbnb， we still have the referral program. They're signing up， I  don't know hundreds of thousands of users every day almost， which， and large portion of  them are signing up through referrals， so that is an example where subsidies are actually  scalable. Now， me handing you a coupon in your hand is not scalable， but doing  that through an email system what through Whatapp or through Messenger or some other channel，  is actually scalable as long as you're not losing the money. You have to have  a very good ROI calculation on the money that you're handing out and knowing that  that's incremental money that if you didn't give that money， those users wouldn't actually start  using your product. So as long as you have a good handle on that， that  is totally fine. Yes.

古斯塔夫A:对骑乘进行补贴或奖励怎么样? 实际上，我认为这些激励措施是超级可扩展的。就像在Airbnb一样，我们还有推荐程序。他们在注册，我几乎不知道每天有成千上万的用户，其中，很大一部分是通过推荐注册的，所以这是一个补贴实际上是可扩展的例子。现在，我给你一张优惠券在你的手中是不可伸缩的，但通过电子邮件系统，通过什么应用或通过信使或其他渠道，实际上是可伸缩的，只要你不失去金钱。你必须有一个非常好的投资回报(ROI)计算，你正在分发的钱，并知道这是增量的钱，如果你不给钱，那些用户不会真正开始使用你的产品。因此，只要你有一个好的处理，这是完全可以的。是啊。

Audience: We talked a lot about product marketing being [inaudible] mentioned that you have to achieve  that before you really invest in growth， so my [inaudible] an app where we have  3% of our users are paying for the premium features， but the other 97% are  using the free features， but [inaudible] of those guys are using it more than two  hours a day， so they really like those free features， [inaudible] aren't willing to pay  for the premium features. So how much of， like before we invest in that growth，  I guess how do we find what those free ... [inaudible] be could still achieve  [inaudible] growth?

听众:我们讨论了很多关于产品营销的话题，提到在你真正投资于增长之前，你必须做到这一点，所以我的[听不见]一个应用程序，我们有3%的用户在为高级功能付费，但其他97%的用户在使用免费功能，但这些人每天使用的时间超过两个小时，所以他们真的喜欢那些免费功能，[听不见]不愿为高级功能付费。那么，在我们投资于这种增长之前，我猜我们如何才能找到那些免费的。。。(听不见的)仍然能够实现(听不到的)增长呢?

Gustaf A.: The question was around they have two groups of users: the free users and then  the paying users， and some of them are very active， and some of them are  not as active， but at least they don't want to pay， how would use growth  there? One of the things I would try to figure out is what is the  retention rate of those paying users? Are they actually sticking around and using the product  that they're paying for? What's the retention rate for the free users? Do that change  once they start paying? And then I will look at conversions or like how， what  percentage of the free users am I converting to paid? There's many different ways to  that. There's one， which is having the freeman concept. You can also have a free  trail， which means you actually don't have freemen. You can just have a very limited  set of free users， and then they kind of have to go to paid. But  ultimately， to the extent that you should be growing all of this， comes down to  how much usage you have from these， the users that you value.

Gustaf A:问题是他们有两组用户:免费用户和付费用户，有些用户非常活跃，有些用户不那么活跃，但至少他们不想付费，如何利用增长呢? 我想弄清楚的一件事是，付费用户的保留率是多少? 他们是不是真的坚持使用他们付钱买来的产品呢? 免费用户的保留率是多少? 一旦他们开始付款就会改变吗? 然后，我会看看转换或喜欢如何，在免费用户中，我转换成付费用户的百分比是多少? 有很多不同的方法。有一个，这就是弗里曼的概念。你也可以有一个自由的轨迹，这意味着你实际上没有自由人。你可以有一个非常有限的免费用户，然后他们不得不去支付。但最终，在一定程度上，您应该不断增长这一切，这取决于您从这些用户，即您所珍视的用户中获得了多大的使用量。

If the paid  users are the one you value the most， if they stop using your product after  three months， then you have a more fundamental problem than the conversation between these two  groups. So I would still go back to retention and look at usage for these  people and see: are they actually sticking around and using the product? Last question from  over here. Yes， in the back.

如果付费用户是你最看重的用户，如果他们在三个月后停止使用你的产品，那么你就有一个比这两个群体之间的对话更根本的问题。因此，我仍然会回到保留，看看这些人的用法，看看:他们是否真的坚持和使用产品? 这里的最后一个问题。是的，在后面。

Audience: The only question I have a friend who is the head of the product growth  involved in a startup， and I was a little taken aback when this person told  me that experimentation is actually really hard for them.

听众:我唯一的一个问题是，我的一个朋友是一家初创公司产品增长的负责人，当这个人告诉我，实验对他们来说真的很困难时，我有点吃惊。

Is there an ideal or a  healthy frequency for experimentation?

是否有一个理想的或健康的实验频率?

Gustaf A.: So the question is sometimes experimentation can be really hard to execute.

古斯塔夫A:所以问题是，实验有时真的很难执行。

Is there an  ideal frequency or which experiment should I be actually be running? For something like a  marketplace， experimentation is really hard.

是否有一个理想的频率或我应该实际运行的实验? 对于市场来说，实验真的很难。

That is correct.

没错。

In that case， it's harder than just  setting up a simple tool online or using Mixpanel to set up your simple A/B  test.

在这种情况下，要比在线设置一个简单的工具或使用MixPanel来设置简单的A/B测试要困难得多。

It's more difficult than that.

比那难多了。

If you are having a simple product funnel， it's  generally not that hard to set up experimentation if you have an engineer and if  you have a decent amount of traffic.

如果你有一个简单的产品漏斗，如果你有一个工程师，如果你有一个不错的流量，一般不难建立实验。

It's not that hard to set it up.  Now， there is different kind of products that make experimentation harder.

设置起来并不难。现在，有不同种类的产品使实验变得更加困难。

I think that if  you're at the stage where you have a lot traffic， in my opinion， you don't  have really an option. You sort of have to invest in some level infrastructure to  use data to make decisions.

我认为，如果你处在交通拥挤的阶段，在我看来，你没有真正的选择。您必须投资于某个级别的基础设施，以使用数据来做出决策。

If you don't do that， the alternative cost is you  end up making a lot of bad decision or either long or they're lucky. You're  lucky because they're right or you're wrong. So you don't really have an option， but  you run experiments.

如果你不这样做，另一个代价是你最终会做出很多错误的决定，或者要么做很长时间，要么他们很幸运。你很幸运因为他们是对的或者你是错的。所以你没有真正的选择，但你运行实验。

It is true that there is some type of product through which  experimentation is easy.

的确，有某种类型的产品可以很容易地进行实验。

If you're running a mobile app， experimentation is not that difficult. There  are lots of tools you can use to run experimentations.

如果你正在运行一个移动应用程序，实验并不是那么困难。有很多工具可以用来运行实验。

If you're running out of  ideas for experiments， well， you should go back to user research and you should look  at other products that are ... Look at something like Pinterest or Airbnb or Facebook，  they're probably highly optimized， so a lot of the things in their funnels is there  for a very specific reasons because of A/B testing.

如果你已经没有实验的想法了，那么，你应该回到用户研究中去，你应该看看其他的产品，比如Pinterest，Airbnb或者Facebook，它们可能是高度优化的，因此，由于A/B测试的特殊原因，它们的漏斗中的很多东西都在那里。

I don't have a better answer  than if you don't do it， you'll have a lot of other problems.

我没有比你不做更好的答案，你会有很多其他的问题。

In terms  of the frequency， there is a cost to setting up an experiment， and that cost  should be minimized as much as possible. But it's sort of like you should try  to get better at it and pick the easiest， smallest thing that you can test，  and just test that.

就频率而言，建立一个实验是要付出代价的，而且这个代价应该尽可能小化。但这就好像你应该试着变得更好，选择最简单，最小的东西，你可以测试，只是测试。

If you have a big new feature you want to test，  well， just test the first part of that feature. Don't test all of it， and  see how people react to the first part of the feature.

如果您有一个想要测试的新功能，那么，只需测试该功能的第一部分。不要测试所有的功能，看看人们对功能的第一部分的反应如何。

I can talk for  hours about this， but thank you very much. (silence)

我可以说上几个小时，但谢谢你。(沉默)
