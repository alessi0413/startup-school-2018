# Dalton Caldwell - How to Apply and Succeed at Y Combinator


Geoff Ralston: Hi, everyone.
This morning we are going to do something a little different than we  normally do on Thursday. We're actually going to have a Startup School lecture by Dalton  Caldwell, my colleague and the Head of Admissions at YC.
This is sort of, rather  than a conversation that sort of fits in between the cracks of the lecture series  that we have organized, this is part of the actual lecture series and is meant  to help you understand more about the YC application process. We're just halfway through the  course, and the YC application closes on October 2nd, so the timing is about right.  A couple of things I wanted to talk about. First of all, as always, if  you parked in that lot, move your car or bike. No one seems to have  done that.
That's great. Secondly, just a word about the application and the eligibility for  the $10,000 grants, because I think that caused a little bit of consternation. We decided  a little bit late in the game that we were going to do a much  better job of evaluating those of you who complete the course, if we actually had  the information contained in the YC application.
It also occurred to us it would be  really good for companies to actually fill that application out.
A bunch of people cried  foul, saying, "Oh my gosh, that's unfair. You're making us do an application." I get  that, because it's a new requirement we added on, but a few points. First of  all, and this was probably our fault and unclear, the deadline does not necessarily apply  to the folks who are just looking to be eligible for the $10,000 grant.
It  doesn't matter. You can fill out that application any time between now and the end  of the course.
In fact, you can do that even if you are applying to  YC.
Although, if you're really applying to YC and you want to get into YC,  it's best to apply before the deadline. We take late applications, but your probability of  getting in decreases.
It's a good idea to fill out the YC application.
It will  help you and your company.
It helps focus your thinking on what's important and what's  not important.
There is no obligation when you fill out a YC application. We're not  going to force you to come to Mountain View and work with us.
If you  get an interview, you do not have to go to the interview. Frankly, I think  that would be strange, because, look, the people at YC sincerely believe that we help  you be successful. So if you get an interview, I would advise you to come  and get the interview, but you do not have to. We hope that it's not  too onerous to fill out the application. Like I said, we believe it's a good  thing for your company. We apologize for figuring this out a little bit late, as  we went around.
There's a bunch of things that happened in this version of Startup  School that were unexpected.
It's not unusual for unexpected things to happen.
Those of you  who are running companies, which is hopefully almost all of you, understand that. So that's  what happens. With that, I would with great pleasure like to introduce Dalton, who is  going to talk about how to apply and succeed at YC.
Thank you.
Dalton Caldwell: Hi there. How's it going? All right. Okay, what we're going to talk about today  is how to apply and succeed at YC.
In my capacity as the Head of  Admissions, I go around the world, and I give talks, and I meet folks that  are applying, and I answer lots of questions.
I think I have a decent internal  model of the kinds of questions that people have and the kinds of things that  people get hung up on. So I'm going to do my best to anticipate what  you're probably thinking about and try to answer those to the best of my ability.  All right. Why is it even worth applying to YC? People ask this question a  fair amount of time.
I would argue that the very act of completing the application  forces you to think about stuff that you should definitely think about. For instance, what  are we building? What is different about what we're doing than other options on the  market? Who are your competitors? That's a good one to ask. Here's one that sometimes  people don't talk about before filling out the application: what is your equity split? You'd  be surprised. People often have never had that conversation. So the very act of going  through and doing an application and working with your co-founder to answer all these things,  I would argue is an extremely good idea. Regardless of whether you do YC, you  should ask yourselves all of these questions.
If you find a bunch of murkiness, where  you can't answer them, that's usually a sign that you should be discussing this more.  So right off the bat, I recommend going and answering the questions.
I think it's  a good idea.
Another thing is, if you are watching this very presentation, there is  a good chance that YC is a great fit for you, right? There's lots of  people that apply, and they don't really know what YC is.
They googled how to  get free money on the internet or something.
Trust me, I read these applications.
It's  clear that they don't exactly understand what YC is and what it's all about.
They  just want money, right? That is not you. You are here. You have been participating  in this.
There's lots of context that you have about YC, and so that out  of the gate means you're going to be much better prepared to fill out this  application and that you're a great fit for the sort of company that we would  want to fund, okay? Another thing is, I think a lot about what you should  be doing as a founder, in terms of cost-benefit analysis on time.
There's a lot  of things that seem like a good use of time that are not a good  use of time, and there's a lot of things that may not seem like a  good use of time that are an excellent use of time. So I would argue  filling out an application should really only take you, I don't know, two or three  hours, and the potential upside is quite huge. Versus other ways you could spend two  or three hours, where the upside is not much at all. Let's talk a little  bit about how you create luck.
This is sort of like a meta point, outside  of the application thing. Great founders create luck, and there's ways that you can create  luck in your life that increase the chances that you will get lucky.
The way  you get lucky is you set yourself up to be lucky as often as possible.  If you can set yourself up so that every single day of your life you  have a shot at something really fortunate happening to you, the odds that something really  fortunate will happen to you is super high.
I would argue applying to YC is  definitely one of those things, right? I answer questions, and invariably people will probably ask  me questions at the end of this that are some kind of a complicated way  of you talking yourself out of why you should do it for some reason.
That  is not a great way to create luck.
The fact is, you're going to set  yourself up to be rejected all the time as a founder, right? You get customers.  Your customers unsubscribe from your service. Your customers are not happy. You're going to try  to recruit people.
That may not work. You're going to be told no all the  time.
If you set yourself up so that you never hear no and that you  never get negative feedback, you're not going to set yourself up to actually be successful.  This is an example of when I talk to people, when I'm on the road,  a lot of the questions or concerns that people have are all stemmed from this,  which is they're afraid of what happens if they don't get in. So they don't  even bother to take the change.
Again, regardless of YC and this particular topic, I  really think this is a good trait for you to develop as a founder. We  work on this in the program with people, of really encouraging people to not be  so afraid of getting told no and systematically trying to set yourself up for good  things to happen to you as much as possible, right? So this is just another  of those situations. Let's talk about some of the reasons that people don't apply.
This  one is very common: I am too early.
There is no such thing as too  early. Sometimes, in the extreme case, people have changed their idea between when they get  invited to interviews and when they get the interview.
That's an extreme case.
That's pretty  early. We also fund people that end up pivoting mid-batch. So that means they've been  working on their startup a negative number of days, right? That is clearly not too  early, also.
Again, there's a lot of ideas around there that the right way to  apply to YC is to wait until you have a certain amount of stuff. Someone  asked me a question, "What's the right amount of MRR to get into YC?" Holy  cow, the answer is zero. Right? That doesn't mean you will definitely get in every  time, clearly, but any kind of roadblock you put for yourself that you're too early,  I would argue is your own self-constrained roadblock, not something that's coming from us. Conversely,  people think they are too far along.
This one is great, because there's this ideal  point between too early and too late that lasts like a week or something, and  otherwise you're too far in either extreme. Most likely you are not too far along.  We have folks every batch that come in. We have folks that, man, had over  a million dollars in annual recurring revenue, folks that have had 20 or 30 employees,  folks that have raised a fair amount of money. Whatever metric by which you think  you're too far, and again, maybe you are genuinely too far, because you've got 1,000  employees or something, the odds are though most of the people who ask this question,  it's because they are launched or they have a little bit of revenue.
They're like,  "Oh, we don't need YC. We've got it all figured out." Again, our data and  the folks that we worked with suggest that you are most likely not too far  along, depending on your circumstance. So if that is the idea, don't put the barrier  into yourself on why you're not going to apply, just because you think you're too  far along.
I'm too experienced.
This is where either you just, oh yeah, I went  to business school, or I've done a startup before. Okay, that's fine, but all you're  doing is limiting possibilities there.
There's lots of folks that are super experienced. Justin Khan  did YC three times and is now the founder of Atrium. He gets something out  of it every time, and clearly he's very experienced.
I would argue much more experienced  that many people that think this about themselves.
Again, this is just creating barriers for  yourself.
This is a common one: there's something specific about my company that YC just  doesn't get. Usually the way that I answer this is by listing all the types  of companies that we fund.
It is too long and too boring to list here,  so I will not attempt to list them all. But look, whatever industry you're in,  whatever you're doing, most likely we fund something kind of like it or equally crazy  to that. We really like crazy and weird things.
Again, what I mean by crazy  and weird, I don't know, we funded nuclear fission and nuclear fusion startups and supersonic  jet startups and, I don't know, all sorts of crazy biotech stuff.
It's unlikely that  we are just going to be like, "Wow, that's too weird for us." Maybe you  are that one, but most likely this is a barrier you're putting in for yourself.  This one is also really common. People think if you do YC, you have to  live in the Bay area forever.
That is not true.
A huge percentage of the  people that we fund, you do the program here, but that's three months.
Then you  go and do whatever you want, right? If you're super worried about, "Wow, I just  love New York City.
That's my home.
I want to be in New York City."  Okay, that doesn't preclude you from wanting to apply to YC. Okay, there's more.
I'll  go through these quicker.
I'm a solo founder. Okay, that's not a reason not to  apply.
It's just, again, maybe you're afraid of rejection or you know that we encourage  you to have co-founders.
That's not a reason to not apply to YC.
I've already  applied to YC once before.
I'll address this later, but just because you didn't get  in once in no way means that you won't do it again.
That's not a  good reason.
I've already raised some money.
I don't know the stats off the top  of my head, but a huge percentage of last batch had already raised on the  order of six figures.
There's definitely some seven figures as well. So in no way  does it preclude you from applying to YC.
In fact, it's extremely common. Finally, there's  competitors. Sometimes, if you're doing a self-driving car startup or a scooter startup or something,  there's other folks that we funded in the space. We fund folks in the same  space all the time.
This does not preclude us from funding you, nor is it  a good reason to not apply. Okay.
There's not many, but I do think there  is a couple of good reasons to not apply. One is you have the kind  of business that is either not anticipated to be fast-growing enough, nor in your ambition  is something that ever makes sense to raise venture capital for.
If that does not  make sense for you, then yeah, you probably shouldn't apply to YC. You should not  raise any venture capital. You should make the growth rate work for you and make  the business model that works for you, and that's a-okay, right? No sweat.
That's a  good reason.
The other thing is, you're just not sure you want to work on  this very long.
All right, that's also a valid reason. We're used to working with  people that are working on something for a very long time. So if you just  want to do something for a few months or put this on your résumé, then,  yeah, that's a fair reason to not apply. How to apply. Okay, this is really  straightforward.
There's a website. You go to the website, and you follow the instructions.
It's  okay to apply early or late, depending on your circumstances, as Jeff said.
It's slightly  harder to get in early or late, and that's just because that's not our primary  time to be cycling through things. But if those are the circumstances you're in, you  should definitely apply.
This is a very common email question we get is, "Hey, it's  two weeks after the deadline. Can I still apply?" Guess what the answer to that  question is? It's a very quick yes. But people want to ask.
They want permission.  Again, this is a recurring theme about founders. You need to learn, you don't have  to ask permission for everything. You don't need our approval to do everything.
There's a  website.
If there's a button where you can apply, you should totally apply, right? You  don't need to email us, have us say yes, and then do it.
That is  an unnecessary step, right? So just keep that in mind. You can just email us,  and again, most of these questions are just people asking should I apply? Our answer  almost invariably is yes, but if you want to ask us, you can.
There's the  email address. Let's talk about what makes a good application.
The first one, I promise  this is not redundant.
It matters, and it's because I read so many applications.
I  have a very good idea of what they actually look like.
I realize that this  talk will go on the internet, and many of the things that I say will  be reflected back.
I'm creating a feedback loop for the things that I read. So  things I'm putting in here are actually meant ...
I want these ideas to get  dispersed, of people knowing what makes a good application, because I think that will make  my job easier, right? This is very intentional.
The first thing is that you would  be shocked how many people don't actually fill out the dang thing properly. Like sloppy,  sloppy, sloppy.
There's whole areas where they don't answer the question whatsoever.
They don't put  in URLs.
They don't fill out their bio.
I don't know.
Again, it's not a  very long application. You'll see yourself. But it is shocking to me what a high  percentage of the time people just don't fill the dang thing out, or put in  lots of errors.
It's just like not great.
Think about applying for a job or  any other kind of professional thing. Lack of professionalism here, not equated with success. So  just fill it out.
It's that simple, and that's why I'm leading with this, is  you would be shocked how few people follow this direction. Maybe they think it's like  a lottery ticket, where if they put in an application, even if it's a bad  one, they might get in. No. Humans read these things.
I read these things, and  I appreciate it if you fill out the application. Second thing is the founder video.  You would be shocked how many people don't follow the dang directions.
There's directions on  how to do the founder video; i.e., it should be a minute long, all the  founders should be in the video. People don't do that. We get the 20-minute spirit  journey video, where I don't know even know what they're ... You know? It's, yeah.  I've seen an hour twenty.
I've seen some weird stuff.
The 20 minute spirit journey  video, not super helpful.
It's really hard to sit there and watch something for 20  minutes. One minute is a perfect amount of time. We give you examples.
Those examples  are great videos. Be like that video.
It's also really good to have the entire  founding team in the video. People are always like, "Hey, I'm here, and I'm in  the airport. My co-founder isn't here, so here's my video." I think that's fine if  that's what you have to do, but maybe just waiting a couple of days until  you can be with your co-founder to do the video would be a good idea.  Because my theory is, a lot of times when people don't follow the directions, it  may be because their co-founder doesn't know they're applying to YC.
There's all these things  under the hood, where the lack of the co-founder in the video speaks volumes. So  maybe you have a great reason why your co-founder isn't in the video, but I  would suggest it, right? And it's in the directions.
I'm not telling you anything that's  not in the directions.
I'm just letting you know, yes, we watch these things, and  yes, it's valuable.
If you just follow the directions, then we're going to be super  happy. When it's like either there's no video or the video is weird ...
Another  thing that people do a lot is they put in an unrelated video of a  product demo that they made with one of those free tools, where there's no humans  in it.
It's like, I can't even describe it.
Anyway, there's a whole genre of  things that people put in there that are not remotely following the directions. So please  follow the directions.
I swear, it matters. Clarify of thought.
A good application is easy  to understand what they're talking about, and it doesn't mean you write tons and tons  of words.
Tons of words definitely has a diminishing return, where we don't know what  you're talking about, and I just can't understand what the application is saying.
Also clarity  on who's building the product.
It's remarkably obfuscated to even figure out what's going on  and who's even building the thing. You'll see who the founders are, and you'll kind  of see what they're working on, but it's really hard to tell who's building it.  So just having it be very crisp of who's building it.
Again, this would put  you way better than average, if you just do these things.
It's so simple, right?  So good applications do these. Let's talk about clarity, because this is definitely something that  is worth talking about. Great applications that I read ... When I read an application  and I know when I read it they're going to get in, they're super easy  for me to read.
It does not require a lot of work.
It doesn't feel  boring or painful.
It just reads with no effort whatsoever.
It's because I understand.
There's  no jargon, and everything just adds up.
It's a great narrative, and it's like, wow,  what a great application, and you move on.
It's very quick. Weak applications obfuscate.
They  obfuscate everything. What is your idea? Obfuscated. Who is on the team? Who's writing the  code? Obfuscated. Who does it work? I have no idea. What is the state of  the company? Are you launched? Do you have users? You have revenue but you're not  launched? What is that? Basically it's like a puzzle. When I'm reading one of these  applications, it's like a brain teaser, where I'm trying to figure out what's going on.  I promise, this doesn't help.
I think a lot of the times, the people obfuscate  because they think that that's what we want to read or we like buzzwords or  we like this stuff, or they're trying to hide something, where the revenue is actually  their personal salary but it's not revenue for the company, but they're putting it in  there because they think they should have revenue. Stuff like that. So we'll ask questions  sometimes to figure this out, but there's such a clear delineation for me as an  application-reader about someone that is clearly communicating in a very crisp way, versus where it's  this brain teaser and I'm trying to pull out, or it's just tons of work  for me to pull out the key facts from the application. Okay? I think this  is broadly applicable.
If you're trying to convince someone to buy your product, or you're  trying to convince someone to work with you, or you're trying to convince and investor  to invest in your startup, and they don't even understand what you're talking about, you  have already lost. Simply going for coherent understanding should always be the first thing you  do, before you're trying to sell someone, right? If I don't understand what the heck  is going on in your application, it doesn't even get to the point where it's  like, "Hey, should we fund this company or not?" We just don't know what's going  on. You will notice that other people will check out.
If you're trying to pitch  your thing to someone and they can't follow you, there's no way you're getting them  to yes. So I just think this is such a broadly applicable skill, and something  that we work on a lot in the batch, is simply being clear and making  sure the other party knows what you're doing first.
Then selling them comes second, once  they actually understand what you're doing.
I put in a few examples here. Here's some  examples of really great descriptions from real YC applications, from real YC companies, that got  in. Here's a company called Remix.
This is the entirety of their answer to this  question.
There's not more.
This is it.
I don't know.
I'm not going to read  it out loud, but it's, what, three sentences? I read that, and I know exactly  what they do.
I know who wants it, and that's it. Great. Seems valuable, right?  This requires so little mental effort to pull out what Remix is and what they're  doing and who it's for, that I'm like, "Great." It takes two seconds to read.  Okay? Here's another one, for a company called TetraScience, also excellent. "We're a software platform  that connects scientific tools to the cloud.
It allows scientists to access their lab device  from anywhere." Blah, blah, blah. "We make a small hardware module which connects those labs  to the web." That's it.
That's great.
That's what we want to read. See? Super  crisp, understandable, no jargon, answers all the key questions. Notice they're not trying to sell  us on any of this.
They're just explaining what it is.
That's why this is  so great, is it's super coherent, super clear. Here's another example from GitLab, when they  applied to YC.
They explain exactly what it is, the history of the company.
They  also add in really impressive facts right at the top. "Over 100,000 organizations use it,  including thousands of programmers at Apple." All right.
That's good. Glad they put that in  there, right? And it's right at the top. Super crisp, right? When we read these  applications, it's very clear what they do, and we're like, "Wow, tell me more.
I  understand what you're doing." Here's an example of a bad one, and I didn't pull  this from a real application.
I wrote this myself, and I wrote this based on  many of the applications I read. You know what I'm saying? I didn't have to  think too hard to write what a bad description is.
It keeps going.
I couldn't  fit it on the slide.
It keeps going for pages.
This isn't even an exaggeration.  This is what a lot of applications are like.
I understand.
I have empathy for  the people that apply with stuff like this, because I think that they think that  this is what we want. Or they think that if they use enough jargon or  buzzwords, that we will get confused and fund them, or something.
It's like stunning us.  Like, "Oh, I don't know. Blockchain? Okay, yes." Instead, this is arduous work that makes  me want to go take a break.
I'm like, "Okay, well, I'm done." I read  one of these, and I need to go get a breath of fresh air.
This  is really hard to read.
It's really hard to understand what's going on.
I still  don't know.
I read this, and I've learned nothing.
I still don't know what this  company does, even after reading the application. So please don't apply with stuff like this.  It's not helping. Make sense? Yeah. Do you see the crisp difference between this and  the good examples? Yeah. Okay. Great applications tell a story. Here's the things that I  would want to pull out of an application that I was reading. Who is on  the team, so this is who we are.
This is what we're working on.
This  is why we're working on it, i.e., how we got the idea. Something like that.  This is what we've accomplished thus far. Even if that's, hey, we haven't done much.  That's okay.
I still want to figure that out.
This is why we're going to  make this work.
That's pretty much it.
These are the things, when I read an  application, that I'm trying to pull out of it.
There's nothing fancy here.
If you  make me work really, really hard to figure this out, that's a sign of not  a great application.
If this just flows out without taking any effort whatsoever, then that's  a good application. Nothing fancy here, right? If you've ever hired people and read resumes  before, it's kind of the same deal, right? You just look at a résumé and  you're like, okay, cool.
There are some key things you're looking for, and then you're  like, sounds good, and you move on.
A résumé that takes tons and tons of  work to make sense of is probably not a great résumé. Okay, here's my number  one tip to applicants on what would help. Make it clear that there's at least  one person on the team who can make the thing that you are working on.  Notice I'm being a little vague in that language, because this is not just software.  This means any kind of technology that you bring to bear, right? If you are  building a cure for cancer, you clearly are not going to have any programmers on  that team, nor would you be expected to do so. But it would certainly be  good, if you're working on a cure to cancer, to have some sort of scientist  on the team. Does that make sense? Same thing, hardware. Our nuclear companies, there were  no programmers that were the founders of the nuclear companies, but you would hope to  see a couple of folks with PhDs in something related to the nuclear field, right?  So some sort of domain expertise.
The reason is, why fund lots of startups, and  if you have these great ideas and no one on the team can actually do  it, you're going to have a hard time. Just having a really good sense, both  in the application and in general, I would recommend having someone on the team that  can do it is highly recommended and changeable. Sometimes there's folks where the team is  not ... Say you are working on something in software, and there aren't folks that  have the credentials or background where they're known software experts.
That's a-okay. We still fund  folks like this. But the burden of proof is on them to prove they can  do it.
I can think of an example of a company where it was like  a self-taught programmer that was so excited and wanted to do their idea so badly  that they went and built the prototype themselves.
It was in the application, "Here, I  built this myself." Great! They got in, right? It's because the burden of proof, not  just let me take your word for it, but you were able to show, even  though you don't have a background of an established software engineer, you built a prototype,  and you brought it to market, and you proved it. So that's a good way  to think about, if you're in this status of having a currently non-technical team, of  just simply backing up the fact that you can bring the product to bear. Whether  that's from a team, whether that's you learning it for yourself, whether it's a friend  helping you with the prototype. Just some evidence that you can bring the product to  market is highly recommended. Last note here, is obfuscating this doesn't help. Sometimes people make  it very vague who built the product, where the prototype came from, or who's going  to build it.
I don't recommend obfuscating this.
I think having it be super crisp  on who is making the thing that you're working on is highly recommended. Okay.
If  you have an application that actually follows the directions really well and is well written  and does the video stuff correctly, and you have one or more folks that can  build the thing that you want to build, and there's some evidence that you're serious  about it ... What I mean by that is, a lot of times people apply  and it's clear they did it kind of on a whim and they're not actually  serious about it whatsoever.
It comes across.
If there's just some evidence that you really  want to do this, that's recommended.
If you meet those things, you get about a  four times higher odds to get an interview.
If you're doing this stuff, getting an  interview is not that crazy hard.
If you fail all these criteria, then, yeah, the  odds are pretty slim.
It's as simple as this, that this is what it looks  like to get an interview, is that you meet these criteria.
Again, it's pretty straightforward  and transparent. Okay? Let's talk about applying more than once. Okay, about a third of  last batch were companies that applied already in the past and didn't get in.
The  reason I say this is, it's not bad to apply and not get in.
That  doesn't ruin your odds.
If anything, it helps you.
The way it helps you is  that your next application shows progress.
If you apply and don't get in and then  you apply again and you show progress, I look at that when I'm reading the  applications.
I know we all do. We're like, "Wow, way to go! They really went  and did it.
I'm so psyched.
They went from an un-launched idea, and then the  next application, they launched it. Wow. Great job." You know? We're impressed.
This is another  thing to think about, is as application readers, we're on your side. We're not looking  at reasons to pick something apart. We're looking for evidence that you're serious and that  things are going well and you're trying really hard. When you see someone expend real  effort and make real progress application to application, that's such a strong signal, right? This  is why you see such a huge percentage of the folks that do YC are  folks that have applied in the past, is because it is such a strong positive  signal. One thing I wanted to mention is that it's basically impossible to network your  way into YC.
The whole reason YC was created was to make it easy for  people that had no network to start a startup and get help and raise money.  The idea of having this website where you can apply and then you do a  10-minute interview and then you get funded was really out there and weird.
I remember  when YC launched.
I was not working here. So we don't expect anyone to have  a network. We don't expect anyone to network with us. One note on this is  I get the sense it's not a lot of people, but some people attempt to  cold email us a lot or do other things that are sort of stalker-ish a  lot.
That does not help. We don't expect you to have done that, and the  vast, vast, vast majority of people that get in are complete strangers we have never  met before.
That's the entire system here, is funding complete strangers. My guess is you're  time is better spent actually making your startup better, than trying to do some weird  stuff to get attention. We always have these really crazy attention-seeking things that happen, and  I can assure you we don't enjoy those things.
Again, what do I mean? People,  they physically mail us weird stuff sometimes.
That's not great, right? Some people put a  lot of effort into this. Not a lot of people, but some people do.
I'm  just letting you know that this is not a good use of time, nor expected  in any way, and that's not how YC is set up.
Another thing to think  about is sometimes there are people that you know are in a network, say alumni  or other people, and they will give you well-intentioned, bad advice. For instance, "Oh, don't  apply until you have 5k MRR." Or, "Oh, I'm really tight with the YC partners,  so let me put in a good word for you." You should be very skeptical  of this stuff. Self-appointed people that are giving you well-intentioned advice that's essentially putting up  barriers between you and the process, I would just be really wary of that.
I'm  sure it's coming from a good place, but again, a lot of times when I  answer questions for people that are applying, some of the weirder ideas come from people  that are vaguely in the network. So if someone's telling you you're too early or  too far along or something, something, something, I would be fairly skeptical, right? Again, you  don't need a network to get in, so expecting the network to give you all  the perfect advice is not always great. Real quick point.
This is not about YC,  but this last topic made me think of it. Watch out for predatory advisors.
In  the entertainment industry, there's lots of people that want to be famous.
There's lots of  people that want to be a recording artists, or they want to be actors, or  directors.
There's a huge supply of them. One of the things of starting out in  the entertainment industry is you meet all of these people that claim to have great  connections and they somehow are going to extract value from these poor naïve people, and  it's really sad.
This exists, for sure, in the tech industry, where there are people  that will just ask for equity or cash compensation and claim all this stuff and  promise you the world.
It's kind of a drag to see this exists, and so  I just want to encourage everyone to be very wary of people like this and  to do research.
That means googling them.
If they claim fantastic things, look into that.  Due diligence on other people they have worked with in the past.
There's just a  whole variety of people that claim to help you break into Silicon Valley that I  think is pretty dubious.
There are some legit things in there, but just like in  the entertainment industry, for every 10 people that claim they can get you a meeting  with the head of all the labels to get you a record deal, nine out  of those are probably lying, you know? Keep in mind, the best way to have  great things happen is to build a great startup and then great folks will find  you, and to be a little wary of some of the folks that are looking  for people just like you that are trying to break in.
All right. So let's  talk about interviews.
If you get invited to interviews, they last 10 minutes.
The interviews  are in person. We expect the full founding team to be there.
There's usually three  to four people from YC in the interview.
The questions are usually very basic. What  we're trying to do is just understand the nuts and bolts of the business.
It's  nothing fancy. Just like I was saying about the application process, people are surprised to  learn that there's nothing too fancy here.
There's no trick questions.
There's no really expert  stuff. We're just trying to understand really basic things, like, "Oh, are you launched? Well,  how are you getting users? Okay, what is the next step for the company? How  do you see this getting big?" These are all very, very basic questions. We're simply  trying to understand this stuff.
Actually, let me go to the next slide.
There's a  lot on the internet about how to prepare for interviews.
I think a lot of  it is a little wrong.
The reason it's wrong is I think it sets up  the mentality that a YC interview is this adversarial thing that it's your job to  beat, right? It's like the interviewers are your opponents, and your job is to go  in there and stun them and confuse them.
Then if you fool us good enough,  then we will fund you.
I think that that is wrong.
Again, I read this  whole genre of blog posts, because they're entertaining to me.
I think it's usually people  that didn't get in that write that, and so I understand how it can feel  adversarial if you didn't get in.
It's also more exciting to write a blog post  about this real exciting interview and it's like, they were grilling me so hard, and  I had to think on the fly.
That's more exciting than, yeah, we had kind  of a boring conversation about my business, right? This is a good thing for any  kind of working with investors.
I want you to put yourself in the shoes of  the person on the other side of the table, which is, what are we trying  to get out of the interview? Imagine you were interviewing a company. What would you  be looking for? You'd be looking for basic answers to your question, and you'd be  looking for having a pleasant conversation, that this is someone that you want to work  with and that you're excited to embark in their journey with them, right? A lot  of what I'm looking for in an interview is can I have a productive conversation  with this person? If someone goes in there and spits out this memorized paragraph of  text about AI something, that's weird.
That's not an organic conversation of someone you might  want to work with.
That's someone going in there that clearly read way too many  blog posts and spent way too much time preparing and is kind of not understanding  the context of the conversation, which is, hey, let's have a conversation about your company.  Instead, they're just spouting nonsense at us, okay? I feel like that's a consequence of  people reading too many blog posts about this adversarial process.
The fact is, when we  fund a company, we are now working really closely with that company forever.
The founders  and your group, they get your cell phone number.
They call you all the time.  They text you all the time.
These become people that are a really important member  of your life, and the people that I fund, this lasts a long time.
I  just want you to know from our perspective, we're just trying to get a feel  of, okay, are we ready to really work with this company and get super involved?  Have that compassion for the people on the other side of the table, versus making  it really like a strange situation where it feels unnecessarily memorized and painful for us,  on the other side of the table.
Again, I think sometimes people try to manipulate  the process.
If we get any hint that you're trying to do something weird, again,  that doesn't engender trust.
I think that's the word. We're looking for trustworthiness and a  sense that we're getting to know the real you in those things. Let's talk about  a successful interview.
Interviews do go really fast, and they're intense.
The reason they're fast  and intense is we're trying to pull of the information out of you quickly, and  there's not a ton of time.
It's not an attempt to trip you up.
It's  simply that that's how much time we have, and we're trying to learn as much  as we can. Successful interviews, the founders demonstrate a mastery of their own business.
They  can talk about what they're working on.
They know their own numbers.
They know how  many users they have.
They know what their plans are.
They know what their equity  split is.
All the things that were in the application, they are like, "Yeah, I  can talk about that." Oh, I have a question. When you said this about that  in your application, what did you mean? "Oh yeah.
I have an answer to that."  We're just looking for you to clarify things that we may not have understood in  the application.
There's no such thing as a correct answer, right? This is not a  quiz show.
This is not a beat the interviewers at their own game.
This is  a legit we're just trying to understand what you're doing.
Another thing is, we know  how risky this is. We know how slim the odds are in an interview are  to succeed.
If you come in there being like, "Everything's great. Everything's perfect.
I have  it all figured out.
I am confident. We're definitely going to be successful.
I promise."  Okay, that's not actually good.
It denotes a lack of self-awareness.
Again, if you over-practice  for these things and you think your job is to come in there and tell  us how you have everything figured out and you're a genius and your whole team  is geniuses and it's like you cannot lose, not a great sign in an interview,  right? A good idea of what is hard about the business and what the challenges  are is expected and recommended, versus the things where you do know what you're doing.  Does that make sense? So yeah, overconfidence not necessarily a great ... You don't see  this in successful interviews. You see self-aware founders.
If you are interviewed and not selected,  we send an email with some feedback. Usually the feedback is focused on a single  thing, which is what we are most concerned about or not convinced about in the  interview.
It's pretty transparent and straightforward.
If you take that feedback and you go work  on it and you apply next batch and you show how you either disproved the  feedback or addressed it, that is highly recommended.
That's totally a great way to get  into YC. You see what I'm saying? Sometimes people get these emails and then you  never hear from them again, or they get really angry or something and argue with  you. You can either prove it and show that the feedback is invalid, like, "Hey,  we're worried about your growth strategy, blah, blah, blah." Well, go prove it. "Yeah, we  did grow. Here's what we did." We love that. We love to be disproven. Or,  Hey, you were right about the growth strategy, and so here's the changes we made.  That's great things to hear, too.
That's a great way to take this feedback into  account, is demonstrate either why it was not valid or that you've addressed it.
Applying  to YC is actually really straightforward and well-documented, and intentionally so.
There are not a  lot of secrets, and we're not looking for people to do too much tricky stuff.  The more you can just make it super clear, tell a super clear story like  I talked about earlier, then you're going to do great.
I would also argue that  the skills you need to successfully apply are broadly applicable to what it takes to  be a great founder, right? If you're going to talk to reporters, if you're going  to be talking to other investors, if you're going to be talking to employees, you're  going to be talking to customers, having all the skills that we mentioned earlier, that  you would want to see in an interview or an application, I think are extremely  useful. Okay? Then final point, if you have questions and the question is in the  form, "Should I apply ..." Most likely the answer is yes. Just always think about  and reflect on if you're being the barrier to setting yourself to being lucky or  having fortunate things happen to you and optimize towards saying yes to things like this.  I think it'll help you in general as a founder. Great.
Thanks so much.
