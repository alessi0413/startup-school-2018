# A Conversation with Ooshma Garg - Moderated by Adora Cheung

\- Thank you for coming today. My name's Adora.

\-谢谢你今天能来。 我叫阿多拉。

I'm one of the partners here at Y Combinator, and today we're gonna talk with, have a conversation with Ooshma Garg, who's the CEO and founder of Gobble, which creates and delivers 15-minute pan dinners to you.

我是Y Combinator的合伙人之一,今天我们要和Ooshma Garg谈谈,他是Gobble的CEO兼创始人,Gobble为您创造并提供15分钟的潘式晚餐。

I am, personally, a happy customer.

就我个人而言,我是个快乐的顾客。

It's great for people who don't have time to do grocery shopping, prep ingredients, actually cook, and then clean up afterwards, so. So, Gobble started in 2011, and while it's doing pretty well today, it's growing around 100 million revenue per week, I believe.

对于那些没有时间去买杂货,准备原料,做饭,然后打扫卫生的人来说,这是很好的选择,所以。 所以,Gobble从2011年开始,虽然今天做得很好,但我相信它每周的收入增长约1亿美元。

It's gone through its many ups and downs, and so with Ooshma today I wanted to talk to her about couple things. One is the evolution of her business. She's mostly been in the food business, but it's iterated her business model many times, and so I think it'd be interesting to talk about that, and then two is something she's an expert in, which is grit and determination.

它经历了很多起起伏伏,所以今天我想和她谈谈几件事。 一个是她事业的演变。 她大部分时间从事食品行业,但她的商业模式已经重复了很多次,所以我认为谈论这件事会很有趣,然后两个是她的专家,这是勇气和决心。

I think she's one of the few people that I've seen that just never gives up, and so I think grit and determination are one of the qualities many people think they have, but when shit hits the fan, things start to fall apart, and so I think it's also interesting to talk about. So, with that, I would love to welcome Ooshma to the stage.

我认为她是我所见过的为数不多的永不放弃的人之一,所以我认为勇气和决心是许多人认为他们具有的品质之一,但当大便打到球迷身上时,事情就会开始崩溃,所以我认为谈论它也很有趣。 所以,有了这些,我很乐意欢迎Ooshma上台。

Thank you.

谢谢你。

\- [Ooshma] Thanks for having me.

谢谢你请我来。

\- Thanks. So, welcome, Ooshma.

\-谢谢。 所以,欢迎你,欧什玛。

\- Thank you for having me.

\-谢谢你邀请我。

\- Thank you for coming. So, maybe we can just briefly start from the very beginning. You were a student at Stanford, and I believe you started your first company then, which was, correct me if I got this wrong, is you helped students get jobs at banks and other companies, so.

\-谢谢你能来。 所以,也许我们可以从一开始就简单地开始。 你是斯坦福大学的一名学生,我相信你那时候开了你的第一家公司,如果我错了,请纠正我,你帮助学生在银行和其他公司找到了工作,所以。

\- Yes, yes.

\-是的,是的。

\- Obviously that didn't work out, and you did Gobble instead, but can you explain why that didn't work out, and what made you think that you should just move on from that idea.

\-很明显,这并没有成功,而你只是狼吞虎咽,但是你能解释一下为什么没有成功,以及是什么让你认为你应该继续这个想法吗?

\- Sure. So, back when I was at Stanford, I started this company out of my dorm room, and a fun visual is that I had this like 150, 200-square-foot room with no space, and I lofted my bed like five inches from the ceiling, and stuffed some like IKEA desks under my bed. We could only fit like three desks in there.

\-当然。 所以,当我在斯坦福的时候,我从宿舍里开了一家公司,一个有趣的画面是,我有一个150,200平方英尺的房间,没有空间,我把我的床像5英寸高的天花板,并填充了一些像宜家的课桌在我的床下面。 我们只能放三张桌子在里面。

I was a junior, so I hired all these freshmen, really smart freshmen as interns, and got a boyfriend so I could sleep somewhere else, for the business, joking, and then our dorm room became our office, and I hid the key in the girls' bathroom, and people would come between class, and get the key from my pink shower caddy, and then go into my dorm room and work on our startup. So, that was our, that was my first company, Anapata, and the idea was to help students get jobs.

我是三年级学生,所以我请了所有这些大一新生,非常聪明的大一新生做实习生,交了一个男朋友,这样我就可以睡在别的地方了,因为公事,开玩笑,然后我们的宿舍变成了我们的办公室,我把钥匙藏在女生的浴室里,人们就会从我的粉红色浴室里拿钥匙出来,然后就进入我的宿舍房间,在我们的创业公司工作。 所以,那是我们的,那是我的第一家公司,Anapata,这个想法是为了帮助学生找到工作。

I was head of this group, Stanford Women in Business, so we were matching people to banks, and law firms, and consulting firms, and I worked on that for three years.

我是这个小组的负责人,斯坦福大学的女企业家,所以我们把人与银行,律师事务所,咨询公司联系在一起,我为此工作了三年。

I bootstrapped it, and no one would fund me.

我自己买的,没人会资助我。

They told me the idea was too niche, or what have you, but really, no one was using LinkedIn at the time, and all of these students are looking for work, so I thought that we could really be the LinkedIn for students, and it was all centered around their interests and student groups. Long story short, the idea was working, and we were making money.

他们告诉我这个想法太利基,或者什么,但实际上,当时没有人在使用LinkedIn,所有这些学生都在找工作,所以我认为我们真的可以成为学生的LinkedIn,它都围绕着他们的兴趣和学生群体。 长话短说,这个想法奏效了,我们也在赚钱。

These companies would write us $20,000, $25,000 checks for annual subscriptions to my recruiting website, and it was a two-sided marketplace, so what really happened is, first of all, I poured everything I had into the business, and my health went down the drain, which later leads to Gobble, but what ended up happening is I learned the hard lesson that whoever pays you kind of owns you, and determines how your product evolves. So, theses banks, and consulting firms, and all of them, were paying me, and they wanted to recruit students based on quotas, based on like their GPA, or their race, or other parts of their background that didn't really have to do with if they were a good cultural match. So, anyways, I was making money, but the mission, and the initial vision, and all of that, of the business, of helping people find good jobs, wasn't true anymore. So, I actually got to a very dark place, and ended up selling the business. So, it could have worked, and it could have worked longer-term, but it wasn't the business I initially intended, and I'm not the kind of person who is just gonna do something to make money.

这些公司会在我的招聘网站上写2万美元,25,000美元的年度订阅费支票,这是一个双向的市场,所以真正发生的事情是,首先,我把我所有的东西都投入到业务中,然后我的健康就耗尽了,这后来导致了狼吞虎咽,但最后发生的事情是,我学到了一个很难的教训,那就是,无论谁付钱给你,谁都拥有你,并决定你的产品是如何进化的。 所以,这些银行,咨询公司,以及他们所有的人,都在向我支付薪水,他们想要基于配额来招募学生,就像他们的GPA,或者他们的种族,或者他们的其他背景,如果他们是一个好的文化配对的话,并不是真的有关系的。 所以,不管怎么说,我是在赚钱,但帮助人们找到好工作的使命,最初的愿景,以及所有这些,都不再是真的了。 所以,我到了一个非常黑暗的地方,最后卖掉了公司。 所以,它可以起作用,也可以长期起作用,但这不是我最初想要的业务,我也不是那种只想做点什么来赚钱的人。

I wanna do something that I believe in.

我想做一些我相信的事。

\- Who did you sell it to?

\-你卖给谁了?

\- So, in our third year, we were taking off with law firms.

\-所以,在我们的第三年里,我们开始与律师事务所合作。

There are thousands of law firms, and only tens of banks on Wall Street, and so I sold it to a company called LawWorks, and basically they're a recruiting company and software, and they wanted to add community to their offering. At that time, it was like 2010, and social, and communities, and all of that, were not as common as they are now.

有数千家律师事务所,华尔街只有数十家银行,所以我把它们卖给了一家叫lawworks的公司,基本上他们是一家招聘公司和软件公司,他们想在他们的产品中加入社区。 那时,就像2010年一样,社会和社区,以及所有这些,并不像现在这样普遍。

\- So, you mentioned, briefly, this is a good transition into, maybe talking about Gobble in the beginning. Your health was going down the drain. How did that actually turn into Gobble itself?

\-所以,你简要地说过,这是一个很好的过渡,也许在一开始就在谈论Gobble。 你的健康状况很糟糕。 这到底是怎么变成戈布尔的呢?

\- Yeah.

\-是的。

I'm sure, as you all are too familiar with, starting a company, at least, especially in the first 1,000 days, is very, very lonely. Very few people believe in the idea outside of yourself, and most people think you're crazy. Most people don't care about you, and so you're the only thing that keeps yourself going, and maybe your cofounder, your partner, but your partner's sick of hearing about it, and your cofounder may or may not work out, so there's lots of loneliness, and basically, this...

我确信,你们都太熟悉了,至少在刚开始的1000天里,开一家公司是非常,非常孤独的。 很少有人相信自己之外的想法,而且大多数人认为你疯了。 大多数人不关心你,所以你是唯一能让自己继续前进的人,也许你的共同创始人,你的伴侣,但你的伴侣已经厌倦了,你的共同创始人可能会成功,也可能不成功,所以有很多孤独感,基本上,这个。。。

I became just very insular.

我变得孤僻。

I stopped visiting my family and my friends.

我不再去拜访我的家人和朋友了。

I was working on the business, but I was staying up too late, and then waking up too late, and then just eating like all this takeout, and soda, and I think it not only affects your physical health, and I gained a lot of weight, but it also affects your mental health. So, all of that came to a head when my dad insisted on visiting, and I was here in California. My parents are in Texas, and my dad is the head of nutrition at UT Southwestern in Texas, so he's spent 30 years of his life studying diabetes, obesity, and nutrition, and then, at home, he would make sure we all ate home-cooked food, and real good food, so, and your parents always know when something's wrong. You can't lie to them, so. So, it's just a matter of time, so. So, anyways, he got on a plane. Actually, first he cooked for three days, and made all of this home-cooked Indian food, stuffed it in these international suitcases that were nicely packed and checked in. Everything's in foil, and ziplocks, and whatever, flew here to California to my little dingy studio apartment, and without even saying hello, comes in the apartment, goes to the fridge, and starts stuffing the food in the fridge, and it just showed his anger, and sadness, and emotion about me not taking care of myself, and how bad things had gotten, and he warmed a little plate of some sabzi, which is a vegetable Indian dish, with some bread and rice, and just put it in front of me, and I had this IKEA two-person dining table in a corner, and I ate this first bite, and I just started crying uncontrollably because the food was so good, and it showed me how much I had lost, and it wasn't just nutrition, it was a sense of self and being, and that's really easy to do, and so anyways, that first bite of my dad's home cooking inspired Gobble, and that moment was when I decided that home cooking, and the sense of a family dinner, is very important to me.

我当时在工作,但我熬夜太晚,醒得太晚,然后就像这些外卖和汽水一样吃,我想这不仅会影响你的身体健康,我的体重增加了很多,而且还会影响你的心理健康。 所以,当我爸爸坚持要去看我,而我在加州的时候,这一切都达到了顶点。 我的父母在得克萨斯,我的父亲是德州西南大学的营养学主任,所以他花了30年的时间研究糖尿病,肥胖症和营养,然后,在家里,他会确保我们都吃家常菜和真正的美食,所以,你的父母总是知道什么时候出了问题。 你不能对他们撒谎,所以。 只是时间问题所以。 所以,不管怎样,他上了飞机。 实际上,他先煮了三天,做了所有的印度菜,把它塞进了装得很好的国际行李箱里。 所有东西都是箔的, 还有齐普洛克, 不管怎样, 飞到加州我那间肮脏的公寓, 即使不打招呼, 在公寓里, 去冰箱, 开始把食物塞进冰箱, 它只是显示了他的愤怒, 悲伤, 以及我不照顾自己的情绪, 以及事情变得多么糟糕, 他还加热了一个小盘子, 是印度菜, 加上面包和米饭, 把它放在我面前, 我在一个角落里有一张宜家二人饭桌,我吃了第一口,我就忍不住哭了起来,因为食物太好吃了,它告诉我我失去了多少东西,不仅仅是营养,还有自我和存在的感觉,这真的很容易做到,不管怎样,第一口我爸爸的家庭烹饪食物激发了我的灵感,那一刻,我决定在家做饭,这是一个重要的时刻。

\- So, the first version of Gobble, if I got it correctly, it was a marketplace for people to create home-cooked meals and sell it on the marketplace. So, that was 2011, and then, I believe, then, one year later, you turned it into, if I have this, I have it written down, catering.

\-所以,Gobble的第一个版本,如果我得到了正确的,它是一个市场,为人们创造家庭烹调的饭菜,并出售它在市场上。 所以,那是2011年,然后,我相信,一年之后,你把它变成,如果我有这个,我就把它写下来,餐饮。

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- And then, year later, it was personalized dinner service, and then, to what it is, pretty much what it is today,

\-一年后,这是个性化的晚餐服务,然后,它是什么,几乎是什么,今天,

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- 10, 15-minutes dinner kits. So, maybe you could start off with, if you remember your one-liner for each four of those business models, to help us distinguish the difference between those four.

\-10,15分钟晚餐套餐。 所以,如果你还记得每四种商业模式的一条线的话,也许你可以从这四种模式中的一条线开始,来帮助我们区分这四种模式之间的区别。

\- Absolutely.

\-当然。

I definitely remember the first one, because it's what I raised our seed round off of. So, we started, after I ate that food, I wanted to replicate my dad in the Bay Area, and I posted on Craigslist, and looked for moms or dads that would cook for me. Anyway, the way that we described the idea, it ultimately became a marketplace for personal chefs and families, and we described it as peer-to-peer lasagne, and everyone remembered that, and just said it, and it was catchy, and weird, and the peer-to-peer economy was really hot at the time. Airbnb was just coming up. Etsy was coming up, and there were all these rental or sharing startups in 2010 to 2012. So, that's how we described the marketplace. Catering was just like home-cooked food for office.

我绝对记得第一个,因为它是我把我们的种子从。 所以,在我吃完这些食物之后,我开始想在海湾地区复制我的爸爸,我在craigslist上发了帖子,寻找能为我做饭的爸爸妈妈。 不管怎样,我们描述这个想法的方式,它最终成为一个个人厨师和家庭的市场,我们描述它为对等的千层面,每个人都记得,并且只是说了出来,它是很吸引人的,也很奇怪,而且对等的经济在当时真的很热。 刚上来。 Etsy即将上市,2010年至2012年,所有这些公司都在出租或共享初创公司。 所以,这就是我们对市场的描述。 餐饮就像是办公室的家常菜。

The personalized dinner service was exactly that.

个性化的晚餐服务正是如此。

It was meals, personalized exactly to your tastes, and our current dinner kits, we describe as, just as a meal-prep service, 15-minute, one-pan cooking.

这是餐,完全按照您的口味个性化,和我们目前的晚餐包,我们描述,就像一个餐前服务,15分钟,一个锅烹饪。

\- So, everyone who built a product always remembers their very first user who wasn't their mom, or dad, or family. Do you remember that person, and what was he or she like?

\--所以,每个制造产品的人总是记得他们的第一个用户,他们不是他们的父母,也不是他们的家人。 你还记得那个人吗,他或她是什么样的人?

\- Yeah. So, recently I met one of our very first like 10 users.

\-是的。 所以,最近我遇到了我们最早的一个像10个用户。

The guy's name is Shealtiel, and it's really funny.

他的名字叫莎拉蒂尔,真的很有趣。

I actually met him, and he was a user of ours in 2011. So, now it's some seven, eight years later.

我实际上遇见了他,他在2011年是我们的用户。 所以,现在大约是七,八年后了。

I met him a few weeks ago at a wedding in New York, and he was like, "Are you Ooshma?" I was like, Yeah. And he was like, "I used to eat your food." And your product goes through so many iterations that when someone remembers the first website of yours, and all those bugs and things, it's really special. He was a Stanford student, and he would email us pages of feedback every time he tried the food, and so it was kind of the canonical early adopter, that someone who really wants to work with you, and who wants to help improve your company, and make it good for them and for everybody else.

几周前,我在纽约的一个婚礼上遇见了他,他说:“你是奥什玛吗?” 我想,是的。 他说,“我过去常吃你的食物。” 而且你的产品经过了很多次迭代,当有人记得你的第一个网站,所有这些错误和事情,它真的很特别。 他是一个斯坦福大学的学生,每次尝试食物的时候,他都会给我们发几页的反馈,所以他是一个典型的早期采纳者,一个真正想和你一起工作,想帮助你改进公司的人,并且为他们和其他人带来好处的人。

\- So, in the beginning, you also did a lot of unscalable things to get users.

\-所以,在开始的时候,你也做了很多无法扩展的事情来吸引用户。

I read you did promo cars everywhere. You went to Starbucks and, I guess, bothered people

我听说你到处都有宣传车。 你去了星巴克,我想是打扰别人了

\- Yes, yes.

\-是的,是的。

\- To order from Gobble. So, a lot of those things probably didn't work, but anything that you remember that actually worked.

\-从戈布尔点餐。 所以,很多这些东西可能不起作用,但任何你记得的东西,实际上是起作用的。

\- Yeah.

\-是的。

There are two things that worked, and I was reflecting on this. One of them is, I guess, the things that work is, when you're just starting out, you can't throw a million dollars into Facebook ads in one week, but it doesn't also work to just talk to 10 individuals.

有两件事起作用了,我在想这个问题。 其中之一就是,我想,当你刚开始的时候,你不能在一周内花一百万美元在Facebook广告上,但仅仅和10个人交谈也是行不通的。

That's too unscalable. So, it's all about reaching microgroups. One thing I did is, I would go to my fave, I went to all my favorite shops, like coffee shops, restaurants, laundromats, whatever, and I actually bought card holders on like a whatever, equipment website, and made promo cards that were business-card size, and it said, like, two free dinners, Gobble.com, and it had the restaurant's name on the back. One of the first valuable innovations, or features, that we released into our product was the ability to accept promo codes, because attribution of your growth is extremely important from day one, or else I can't tell you what's working or not working. So, there's ZombieRunners on California Avenue, it's this coffee shop, and it's inside a running store, that used to be a movie theater.

那太难扩展了。 所以,这一切都是为了达到微群体。 我做的一件事是,我会去我最喜欢的地方,我去了所有我最喜欢的商店,比如咖啡店,餐馆,自助洗衣店等等,实际上我在一个随便的地方,设备网站上买了持卡人,制作了名片大小的宣传卡,上面写着,就像两个免费的晚餐,Goble.com,餐厅的名字就在后面。 我们在产品中发布的最有价值的创新或功能之一是能够接受Promo代码,因为从产品开发的第一天起,你的成长特性就非常重要,否则我就不能告诉你什么是有效的,什么是无效的。 所以,加州大街上有僵尸,这是一个咖啡店,它在一个流动的商店里,那曾经是一个电影院。

It's very weird. You should go there.

很奇怪。 你应该去那儿。

It's my favorite coffee shop, and so, they put a little thing at their register, and it turned out to be more effective than the nail salons, the laundromats, anything else. Another YC company order-ahead, actually, for a while, was very successful with coffee shops, and promos, and ordering at coffee shops. One other thing was, I spoke to as many meetup groups, or moms groups, and neighborhood groups, as possible, and I would get them, I would always try to have an offer that was, I tested offers, and I knew what would work, so every single one of them would send my offer on their email list, and it had to be an email with your offer to a group, and that converted.

这是我最喜欢的咖啡店,所以,他们在收银台上放了一个小东西,结果比钉子沙龙,自助洗衣店,其他任何东西都更有效。 事实上,有一段时间,YC公司的另一家公司在咖啡店,促销活动和在咖啡店的订单上都非常成功。 另一件事是,我和尽可能多的会议小组,或者妈妈小组,社区小组进行了交谈,我会得到他们,我总是试图得到一个提议,我测试的提议,我知道什么是可行的,所以他们中的每一个都会把我的提议发送到他们的邮件列表上,它必须是一个与你的提议一起发送给一个团体的电子邮件,然后转换。

\- The attribution point is very, I think, key there, which is, even if you're doing a spray-and-pray method of just like, everyone use me, at least you know, when they come in the door, where they actually thought of you.

\-我想,归因点很关键,就是,即使你在用一种喷雾和祈祷的方法,就像,每个人都在用我,至少你知道,当他们走进门的时候,他们真的想到了你。

\- Absolutely, yes.

\-当然,是的。

\- Cool. So, again, and going back to the evolution of the business, at what point in each of the business models did you realize, oh, this isn't it, I gotta think of something else?

\-酷。 那么,再次回到业务的发展,在每一个业务模型中的什么时候,你意识到,哦,不是这样的,我还得想点别的?

\- Right.

\-对。

The funny thing is that, and so first of all, we talked about these business models. All of that was going on from 2011 to 2014. So, between three and a half years, which is still roughly that 1,000 days of finding product-market fit, we had four different iterations to the product, and this is a minor little point, but I know that, I think Michael Seibel spoke recently, and he said that, he talked about the difference between pivoting and iterating, and I thought that was really important, because people say Gobble pivoted, but we didn't pivot. We didn't turn into some online video game. We just iterated, and then found success. So, I think that nuance is important, because pivoting, I think, you don't carry a lot of your learnings with you.

有趣的是,我们首先讨论了这些商业模式。 所有这一切都发生在2011年至2014年。 所以,在三年半的时间里,也就是在大约1000天的时间里,我们对产品进行了四次不同的迭代,这只是一个小问题,但我知道,我想迈克尔赛贝尔最近说过,他说,他谈到了旋转和迭代的区别,我认为这很重要,因为人们说Gobblized,但我们没有做支点。 我们没有变成在线视频游戏。 我们只是迭代,然后发现成功。 所以,我认为细微差别是很重要的,因为旋转,我认为,你并没有带着很多你学到的东西。

Iterating is always building on your previous learnings. So, with these business models, and different iterations and launches, they all failed for different reasons. We had a marketplace first, and everyone loved the food, because it was this authentic, small-batch, home-cooked food from real people: Italian grandmas, and Mexican moms, and Ethiopian chefs, and things, and food you can't get anywhere else, that's not ruined by capitalism, I guess. Anyways, that food wasn't scalable. So, we started getting success with that marketplace idea, but when I asked this Italian mom in San Carlos to make me 200 of her lasagne, when she used to make 20 a day, it wasn't fun anymore, and she didn't wanna make 200, and she wasn't a caterer. So, that model... Airbnb is a peer-to-peer model that can scale, and it's sharing an asset.

迭代总是建立在你以前所学的基础上。 因此,有了这些业务模型,以及不同的迭代和启动,它们都因为不同的原因而失败。 我们首先有一个市场,每个人都喜欢这种食物,因为这是真正的,小批的,来自真人的家庭烹调的食物:意大利外婆,墨西哥妈妈,埃塞俄比亚厨师,还有其他任何地方都买不到的食物,我想这不是资本主义所破坏的。 不管怎么说,那种食物不是可伸缩的。 所以,我们开始在市场上取得成功,但是当我要求圣卡洛斯的意大利妈妈给我做200份意大利千层面时,当她以前每天做20份时,这已经不好玩了,她也不想做200份,她也不是一个餐饮商。 所以,那个模特。。。 AIRBNB是一个可以扩展的对等模型,它共享一个资产。

It's sharing a space.

共享一个空间。

This is a peer-to-peer model that has a lot of breakpoints at scale, of quality, time, capacity, and so on. So, that's why the marketplace model didn't work. We were supply-constrained, not by the number of chefs, but by the juice we could squeeze from each of our SKUs on the marketplace.

这是一个对等模型,在规模,质量,时间,容量等方面有很多断点。 所以,这就是市场模式不起作用的原因。 我们的供应受到了限制,不是因为厨师的数量,而是因为我们可以从市场上的每一条鱼中榨出汁来。

Then we pivoted to catering, because we had built that marketplace with seed funding, and we maybe had like a half a year of money left, or something, but one of our investors was very insistent that we pad our growth with money, and we do something that'll definitely make us money, and so I went into the catering world. Frankly, to me, I think it's very easy, and I didn't really want to do it. You just get, we got Box.net, and Pinterest, and these companies signed on, and they rarely quit, and so you're just making this money in the background. We did that. We made good money, and we showed growth, but the problem is that when we went to raise series A, the investors asked, how much of your money is from families, and the model you're pitching, and how much of your money is from catering and from enterprise? And at that point, some 75% was from enterprise, because when you do something like that, like the previous startup lesson we learned, all your attention goes to what's giving you the most money, and so that really sucked, because unless I wanted to build a catering business, then I wasn't gonna get funding. So, we were in a pinch then, and I had to raise a bridge round, and wind down the catering business, which was hugely unpopular, because we were making lots of money, but it wasn't my long-term vision.

然后我们选择了餐饮,因为我们用种子基金建立了这个市场,也许还有半年的时间,但我们的一个投资者坚持要用钱来支撑我们的增长,我们做的事情肯定会让我们赚钱,所以我走进了餐饮界。 老实说,对我来说,我认为这很简单,我真的不想这么做。 你刚刚得到,我们得到了Box.net和Pinterest,这些公司签了名,而且他们很少辞职,所以你只是在后台赚钱。 我们做到了。 我们赚了很多钱,而且我们表现出了增长,但问题是,当我们去筹集A系列资金时,投资者问,你的钱有多少是来自家庭,你要推销的模型,你的钱有多少来自餐饮和企业? 那时,大约75%的人来自企业,因为当你做类似的事情时,就像上次我们学到的创业经验一样,你所有的注意力都集中在给你最多的钱上,所以这真的很糟糕,因为除非我想建立一个餐饮企业,否则我不会得到资金。 所以,当时我们手头拮据,我不得不建了一座桥,把餐饮行业的生意收了下来,这是非常不受欢迎的,因为我们赚了很多钱,但这不是我的长期愿景。

The vision was that people don't have access to this home-cooked food, and I wanted to crack it, and figure it out, and give it to everyone. So, we wound that down because it wasn't part of the long-term vision. So, then we focused on this personalized dinner service.

我的想法是,人们无法接触到这种家常便饭,我想把它弄出来,弄清楚,然后把它送给每个人。 所以,我们结束了,因为这不是长期愿景的一部分。 所以,我们专注于个性化的晚餐服务。

I still, today, think that the power of personalization, what Amazon brings to e-commerce, and what Netflix and Spotify bring to movies and music, that level of personalization has not taken off in food, and just like Google, with search, the company that cracks it in food, I think, will be the long-term winner, and have all these learnings built on top of each other, to where you build a long-term, sustainable advantage. So, that's what we did with that personalized dinner service. We took these chefs, and then we started using restaurants, and caterers, and we focused on the technology, because that's the talent that we had in our headquarters. We had engineers, and product people. So, we focused on the tech to match, to take, we allowed people to give us whatever taste they wanted, so we ended up getting thousands of picky eaters, and people who didn't eat nightshades, and they were vegan, but they still didn't likes olives, and lettuce, and crazy stuff, and no matter what your tastes were, I said I would feed you, and so anyway, that model really stretched our technology, and by doing the hard thing, we learned.

今天,我仍然认为,个性化的力量,亚马逊给电子商务带来的好处,Netflix和Spotify给电影和音乐带来的好处,这一个性化水平在食品领域还没有得到充分发挥,就像谷歌(Google)一样,我认为,在食品领域开展个性化服务的公司将是一个长期的赢家,所有这些知识将建立在彼此之上,从而为你构建一个长期,可持续的优势。 所以,这就是我们对个性化服务所做的。 我们接受了这些厨师,然后我们开始使用餐馆和餐饮商,我们专注于技术,因为这是我们在总部拥有的才能。 我们有工程师,和产品人员。 所以,我们把重点放在技术上,让人们给我们他们想要的任何口味,所以我们最终得到了成千上万的挑食者,不吃夜光的人,他们是素食者,但他们仍然不喜欢橄榄,莴苣和疯狂的东西,不管你的口味如何,我说我会喂你,所以,不管怎样,模型真的扩展了我们的技术,并通过做艰苦的事情,我们学到了。

\- If you're a vegan and don't like lettuce, what are you eating?

\-如果你是素食主义者,不喜欢生菜,你在吃什么?

\- I know.

\-我知道。

I don't know. Like, lots of beans.

我不知道。 很多豆子。

\- So, you moved the business model a little bit each time, or quite a bit, actually, each time

\-所以,您每次都稍微移动业务模型,或者实际上每次都移动相当多的业务模型

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- and so one of the difficult things in doing that is taking the risk, and bringing down your current business for, hopefully, future success, and that, I think, a lot of people actually don't do that because it's very, very scary.

\--所以,这样做的一个困难之处就是冒着风险,为将来的成功而降低你目前的业务,我认为,很多人实际上并不这么做,因为这是非常,非常可怕的。

They just try keep pushing the current model, trying to make it work. So, was it scary for you, and what was your thought process in actually just saying, no, not gonna do this enterprise catering anymore, even though it's making me tons of money?

他们只是试图继续推进当前的模式,试图使其工作。 那么,这对你来说是不是很可怕,你的想法过程是什么呢?你只是说,不,不打算再做这个企业餐饮了,即使它能让我赚很多钱?

\- Right, right, it was so scary.

\-对,对,太可怕了。

It was really scary, and actually, some of our investors would call me into their office, and just use it as, like, me as a punching bag, and sit down at their reclaimed wood table in their kitchenette or something, and they would like, I'd be sitting, and I'd stand up, and they'd be like, and every time there's new startups coming up, the grass is always greener, because the investors know all your problems, and they don't know any of the other problems. So, anyway, so they would be like, "This company, Munchery, is starting, "and this company, OrderAhead, is starting, "and all these companies are starting, "and what are you doing?" and it was much louder, and much worse than that, and so, but you know? I have found, I think that's what you mentioned earlier, about the grit and determination.

这真的很可怕,事实上,我们的一些投资者会把我叫进他们的办公室,把它当作一个沙包,就像我一样,然后在他们的小厨房里坐在他们回收的木头桌子上,他们会想,我会坐着,我会站起来,他们会想,每当有新的创业公司出现,草总是更绿,因为投资者知道你所有的问题,他们不知道。 所以,不管怎么说,他们会说,“这家公司,麦奇瑞,要开始了,”这个公司,Orderahead,要开始了,“而所有这些公司都在开始,”你在做什么?“而且比这还响得多,而且还差得多,所以,你知道吗?我想这就是你刚才提到的,关于毅力和决心的问题。

I don't know if it's learned, or what it is. Over so many years, I have found that I cannot listen to anything, there's nothing more loud than my gut, and it just, when you know something, and you've been in it for three years, or thousands of days, you can't avoid it. You know what you have to do. Other people think about you like 1% of the year, and just in the one-hour meeting, and so I think early on we put a lot of weight into investor meetings, even into YC partner meetings, into all these meetings, and it can really throw you off your game for a few days. You're like, ugh, this one person didn't like my idea. Who am I? And it's just something you have to get through, and I would always try to justify each direction with logic, and with market drawings, and one book that really helped me was Blue Ocean Strategy.

我不知道它是不是已经学会了,或者是什么。 这么多年来,我发现我什么也听不到,没有什么比我的直觉更响亮了,它只是,当你知道什么,你已经在其中呆了三年,或数千天,你无法避免它。 你知道你要做什么。 其他人认为你喜欢一年中的1%,而仅仅是在一个小时的会议上,所以我认为早期我们在投资者会议上,甚至在YC合伙人会议上,在所有这些会议上,都有很大的分量,这真的会让你在几天内放弃你的游戏。 你就像,呃,这个人不喜欢我的主意。 我是谁? 这只是你必须经历的事情,我总是试图用逻辑和市场图来证明每一个方向的合理性,一本真正帮助我的书是“蓝海战略”(Blue Ocean Strategy)。

It's my favorite business book to date, and it talks about how companies broke through the noise in existing industries.

这是我迄今为止最喜欢的商业书籍,它讲述了公司如何突破现有行业的噪音。

Talks about Southwest Airlines, Yellowtail wine, and some really interesting companies that no one thought would work, and it gives you a framework with which to think about your company, and I would draw that framework, and keep using it as my north star.

说到西南航空公司,黄尾酒,以及一些真正有趣的公司,没有人认为会成功,它给你一个框架来思考你的公司,我会画出这个框架,并继续使用它作为我的北极星。

\- In a previous talk, and let me read this so I get it right, you said something pretty insightful, which is, "Product market fit is not just an a-ha moment. "It's the summation of lots of broad experiments "and micro-learnings over many years." Can you briefly expand on that? A common mistake is for people, when they look at product-market fit, is to just look at one metric, and then, if it moves in one direction, then that's good. So, what did you look at the beginning in? How did you visualize this summation of stuff?

\--在之前的一次演讲中,让我来读一读,所以我理解得很好,你说的是漂亮的见地语,那就是:“产品市场适配不仅仅是一个关键时刻。”这是多年来大量广泛实验的总结“和微观学习。” 你能简要地说明一下吗? 一个常见的错误是,当人们看产品市场适合与否时,只看一个指标,然后,如果它朝着一个方向移动,那就好了。 那么,你在开头是怎么看的呢? 你是怎么想像这些东西的总和的?

\- Yeah. Ultimately, I think that product-market fit is the center of the Venn diagram of ability to grow, on one side, and retention, on the other side, and so, if you look at our history, in the marketplace model we weren't able to grow because of the chefs. We were supply-constrained.

\-是的。 最终,我认为产品与市场的匹配是Venn图的中心,这张图显示了一方面增长的能力,另一方面保持的能力,因此,如果你看一下我们的历史,在市场模式中,由于厨师的原因,我们无法增长。 我们的供应有限。

In the personalized dinner model, we actually weren't able to grow really fast because of the customers. Even though it was personalized, the food wasn't better than the best takeout that you could order. So, if you wanna change the world, or change your industry, you have to do something that is materially better, like iPhone-level better than the market. So, people weren't racing to our door, so we didn't have that ability to grow. Our dinner-kit model has the ability to grow and scale, internally and externally, from customer demand, and it also has high retention.

在个性化的晚餐模式中,由于客户的原因,我们实际上无法实现快速增长。 即使它是个性化的,食物也不比你能点的最好的外卖好。 因此,如果你想改变世界,或改变你的产业,你必须做一些实质上更好的事情,比如iPhone水平比市场水平更好。 所以,人们不是冲着我们的门来的,所以我们没有成长的能力。 我们的餐具模型有能力增长和规模,内部和外部,从客户的需求,也有很高的保留。

\- So, moving on to, maybe, more about grit and determination. So, in the beginning, at Stanford you were a bioengineering major,

\-所以,接下来,也许,更多的是关于勇气和决心。 一开始,你在斯坦福大学主修生物工程,

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- so technical, but not a coder. How did you manage actually doing all of this without being technical?

\-所以是技术性的,但不是编码器。 你是如何在不具备技术性的情况下做到这些的呢?

\- Yes. Hmm. Well, initially, and everyone is gonna use their skill sets, and I think the one common theme is that, in the first few months you need to prove your concept. You need to have an MVP. You can do that with code. You can do that with sales, whatever. So, I did not know how to code.

\-是的。 嗯。 嗯,一开始,每个人都会使用他们的技能集,我认为一个共同的主题是,在最初的几个月里,你需要证明你的概念。 你需要一个MVP。 你可以用代码来做。 你可以用销售,随便你。 所以,我不知道怎么编码。

I learned PHP, but in both my businesses, in the recruiting business and the chef business, or the food business I have now, I made initial sales without a website, and I proved our concept in the first three months, before any other kind of funding. So, with the recruiting business, I did know like Photoshop and design, and I taught myself all of that, and loved it, so I enjoyed that, and I designed these sales packages that would, like, and I made up stuff.

我学过PHP,但在我的业务,招聘业务和厨师业务,或我现在的食品业务中,我在没有网站的情况下进行了最初的销售,在最初的三个月里,我证明了我们的概念,在任何其他类型的资金之前。 因此,在招聘业务中,我确实知道像Photoshop和Design,我教会了自己所有这些,并且喜欢这些,所以我喜欢这些,我设计了这些销售软件包,这些软件包可以,可以,可以,我还可以编东西。

I was like gold, platinum, whatever, $20,000, and I would see if people would give it to me, which is very bold, as a college student, and I had a mockup of a website that wasn't built yet, and I took a semester off, and tried, and only did sales, because that was my proof of concept, and my parents said that only if I got a sale could I not go work on Wall Street, which was horrible. So, side note, I didn't get a sale that semester, and I met like maybe 80 or so people through introductions, and I went to go work at Morgan Stanley in 2008, and that horrible summer, and I hated my life.

我就像黄金,铂金,不管是什么,2万美元,我会看看人们会不会给我,作为一个大学生,这是非常大胆的,而且我有一个尚未建成的网站的模型,我休了一个学期假,尝试,只做销售,因为这是我的概念的证明,我的父母说,只有我得到一个销售,我不能去华尔街工作,这是可怕的。 所以,顺便说一句,那学期我没有得到一笔大减价,我通过介绍认识了大约80个左右的人,我在2008年去摩根士丹利上班,那个可怕的夏天,我讨厌我的生活。

It was like equities trading, and three weeks in, I got a check in the mail for $10,000, 'cause it was the founding customer price from this law firm, and it was like the coolest day of my life.

这就像是股票交易,三个星期后,我收到了一张1万美元的支票,因为这是这家律师事务所的创始客户价格,这是我一生中最酷的一天。

It was revenue.

是收入。

It was validation, and it took me like seven to 10 days to figure out how to quit the internship. People were all like, you'll get blacklisted. You'll never get a job, and I told the head of the program, and he said, you will always have a job here, but you will never come back, and I thought that was weird at the time, and now I fully understand it, and it's because, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, in your heart, in a way. So, anyways, I think the quitting is hard. So, long story short, but it's hard to avoid.

这是一次验证,我花了七到十天的时间才想出如何放弃实习。 大家都说,你会被列入黑名单的。 你永远也找不到工作,我告诉项目负责人,他说,你永远在这里有工作,但你永远不会回来,我当时认为这很奇怪,现在我完全理解了,因为,一个企业家,永远是一个企业家,在你的心里,在某种程度上,是一个企业家。 所以,不管怎样,我认为辞职很难。 长话短说,但这是很难避免的。

\- So, around 2011, 2014, you had a hard time raising money, correct? So, how did you, I mean, it's three years. How did you fund all of this, and then also, at the same time, what did you spend your days doing? You must have been really... When you can't get money, that's a huge distraction, so how did you focus on your business and keep going?

\-那么,大约在2011年,2014年,你很难筹到钱,对吗? 那么,你是怎么,我是说,三年了。 你是如何为这一切提供资金的,同时,你又花了多少时间在做什么? 你一定是。。。 当你拿不到钱的时候,这是一个巨大的分心,那么你是如何专注于你的业务并继续前进的呢?

\- Yes. So, first of all, over those three and a half years of finding product-market fit, our monthly burn was $40,000, on average.

\-是的。 所以,首先,在这三年半的时间里,我们的产品市场适合,我们的每月烧伤$40,000,平均。

That's pretty low.

太低了。

That's not a fancy office.

那不是什么花哨的办公室。

That's not 10 people. We kept it to about four people, and everyone had to be like cofounder-style generalist, because we were still iterating. So, if you make your burn 40K, you can make your 1.5 million last a while, but we raised two bridge rounds during that time, and there were some investors who refused to invest, some of them who would listen to the next iteration, and invest in me. Both of those bridges were like 200-some K, and one critical thing: there was a time, in 2013, when no one would invest in me, and I was running out of all of my money, and we had like one payroll in the bank.

不是10个人。 我们把它保持在四个人左右,每个人都必须像共同创始人风格的多面手,因为我们仍然在迭代。 所以,如果你赚到了40K,你就可以赚到150万,但在这段时间里,我们花了两个桥轮,有些投资者拒绝投资,有些人会听下一次迭代,然后投资于我。 这两座桥都有200多公里长,但关键的一点是:在2013年,有一段时间,没有人会投资于我,我的所有钱都用完了,而我们银行里就只有一份工资单(注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注)。

I think our bank was like $8,000 or something, and that's when I did YC. So, I didn't do YC at the beginning of Gobble.

我想我们的银行大概是8000美元之类的,那是我做YC的时候。 所以,在Gobble开始的时候我没有做YC。

I did YC three and a half years into the struggle, when I was, I didn't know I was about to figure it out. Everybody had lost faith, and I'm the only one who had faith, and the only money I could get was from Jessica and P. G., and so I did YC, and they said they would help me raise a series A, they would fund me for three more months, and six months after that, we figured out our 15-minute one-pan dinner kit.

我在斗争中奋斗了三年半,当我还在的时候,我不知道我会想出办法来。 每个人都失去了信心,我是唯一有信心的人,我只能从Jessica和P.G。那里得到钱,所以我做了YC,他们说他们会帮我筹集一个系列A,他们会再资助我三个月,六个月后,我们想出了我们的15分钟一盘的晚餐套件。

\- So, you mentioned you had employees during this hard time. How did you keep them motivated to keep going?

\-所以,你说你在困难时期有员工。 你是怎么让他们有动力继续下去的?

\- Mm, that's a tough one.

\-嗯,那很难。

I think that there's a lot of turnover in the early days, and even in the later days, after venture financing, and you're learning how to hire execs, but the employees that ended up lasting the longest were by referral, and so there was some shared values, and shared trust there, and I also really clued them into the hard times. Sometimes you think you're protecting people by not telling them, but actually, your closest employees, especially when you're four to six, if you bring them into the challenge, and if they are challenge oriented, they will stay with you, but if you hide it, then they're not really feeling that excitement and that challenge.

我认为,在早期,甚至在后期,在风险投资之后,会有大量的营业额,而且你正在学习如何雇用高管,但最终持续时间最长的员工是通过推荐来的,因此在那里有一些共同的价值观和共同的信任,我还真的让他们进入了艰难的时期。 有时你认为你不告诉别人是在保护别人,但实际上,你最亲密的员工,特别是4到6岁的员工,如果你把他们带到挑战面前,如果他们是以挑战为导向的,他们就会和你呆在一起,但是如果你隐瞒了这一点,他们就不会感到真正的兴奋和挑战。

\- At one point you said that you got an acquisition off, or one of your investors wanted you to just get acquired by a clothing startup,

\-有一次你说你被收购了,或者你的一个投资者想让你被一家服装初创公司收购,

\- A clothing startup.

\-一家服装初创公司。

\- which, completely different.

\-这完全不同。

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- I mean, you're having hard time, and here's, potentially, money in your bank account.

\-我的意思是,你现在很困难,而且,有可能,在你的银行帐户里有钱。

What was your thought process in just turning that down?

你是怎么想的?

\- Yeah.

\-是的。

I've thought a lot about this. Right now, even in our space, there's a lot of consolidation, in the food space, in the meal-kit space.

我想了很多。 现在,即使在我们的空间,也有很多整合,在食物空间,在饭盒空间。

If you see the news, it's a very popular drama in the news.

如果你看新闻,它是一个非常流行的戏剧在新闻中。

I mean, there's all these companies, like Facebook, or Snapchat, or this or that, that have turned down different offers over time, and sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong, judged by society.

我的意思是,所有这些公司,比如Facebook,Snapchat之类的,都在一段时间内拒绝了不同的出价,有时是对的,有时是错的,是由社会来评判的。

I just see so much potential in Gobble, and once we, early on, it was just that, early on I turned that clothing startup thing down, in that product-market fit time, because this is what I wanna work on, and I had nothing to lose.

我只是看到了Gobble的巨大潜力,而一旦我们,在早些时候,只是,在那个产品市场合适的时候,我拒绝了那个服装初创公司的事情,因为这是我想要的工作,我没有什么可失去的。

I didn't have kids, or whatever, and I just didn't imagine a better life than working on a hard problem, and now we've started doubling or tripling, year on year, and so if someone were to acquire us now, and we can't weather the storm of a bad meal-kit market, I think we're leaving billions on the table.

我没有孩子,或者其他什么,我只是想像没有一个比努力解决一个棘手问题更好的生活,现在我们已经开始翻倍或翻三倍,每年,所以,如果有人要收购我们,现在,我们不能承受糟糕的餐具市场风暴,我认为,我们留数十亿的桌子在桌子上。

\- Speaking of competition, there's been billions of dollars in venture funding going into competitors, or so-called competitors like Blue Apron, Plated, and so on and so forth.

\--说到竞争,有数十亿美元的风险资金流入竞争对手,或所谓的竞争对手,如蓝围裙,电镀,等等。

I mean, you were the original meal-kit company.

我是说,你是最早的餐饮公司。

What do you,

你干嘛,

\- yes.

\-是的。

What do you think about? Like, all that money's going over there, but you're like, I'm here, surviving, and I'm growing fast.

你在想什么? 就像,所有的钱都在那里,但是你就像,我在这里,活着,而且我成长的很快。

What's really going in your mind?

你到底在想什么?

\- Yeah. Well, we can look at the silver lining of it, which is that necessity breeds invention, and so by not having that much money, we didn't get comfortable, and we had to innovate, and we had to have good numbers. So, I'm not saying that we should all starve our companies, but because we were somewhat cost-starved, I wasn't distracted by lots of fancy things, and I just focused on making all the dollars count, and doing something meaningful.

\-是的。 好吧,我们可以看看它的一线希望,那就是需要孕育了发明,所以没有那么多钱,我们不舒服,我们必须创新,我们必须有好的数字。 所以,我并不是说我们都应该饿死我们的公司,但因为我们有些成本饥饿,我没有分心许多花哨的事情,我只是专注于使所有的美元的重要性,并做一些有意义的事情。

\- So, you talk a lot about mission, but beyond that, what actually, really, like how did you keep going, over the seven, eight years? Is it genetic? What do you think it really is, beyond just the mission?

\-那么,你说了很多关于使命的事,但除此之外,什么,实际上,真的,比如,在过去的七,八年里,你是怎么坚持下去的呢? 是遗传的吗? 你认为这真的是什么,不仅仅是任务吗?

\- Wow, hmm. Man, maybe it is some kind of like nature-nurture thing. Mission is a big part of it, but with regards to the grit and determination thing, from an early age, I think I just... My parents wanted me to go to this school, this all-girls school, and I hated my current school.

\-哇,嗯。 伙计,也许这是某种类似于自然培育的东西。 使命是一个很大的一部分,但关于勇气和决心的事情,从很小的时候,我想我只是。。。 我的父母想让我去这所学校,这所女子学校,我讨厌我现在的学校。

I was bullied a lot, and there was bad phrases and racist things on my locker, and bad stuff, and I applied to this girls school in kindergarten, and I didn't get in, and then in 1st grade, and I didn't get in, and in 2nd grade, and I didn't get in, and you had to take this ERB test, and then in those early grades they're asking you like, what's a triangle, or something, and I didn't get in, so I was like, what's going on? And my parents weren't donating, and there's all these other factors, but I didn't know that, and so I kept applying, and like 3rd grade, 4th grade, 5th grade, didn't get in, and I remember one time, my parents were like, the test is coming up.

我经常被欺负,在我的储物柜上有一些糟糕的短语和种族主义的东西,还有一些糟糕的东西,我在幼儿园的时候申请了一所女子学校,但我没有入学,在一年级的时候,我没有入学,在二年级的时候,我没有入学,你必须参加这个ERB考试,然后在那些早期的年级里,他们问你,我喜欢什么三角形,什么,什么,什么,我不喜欢什么? 我的父母没有捐赠,还有很多其他的因素,但我不知道,所以我继续申请,就像三年级,四年级,五年级一样,没有得到资助,我记得有一次,我的父母说,考试就要来了。

This is for your future. You need to do this, and I was just so mad.

这是为了你的未来。 你得这么做,我太生气了。

I just remember being so defeated, and so distraught, and like I was letting them down, and I didn't wanna take the test.

我只记得我是如此的失败,如此的沮丧,就好像我让他们失望了,我不想参加考试。

I was like, who needs this school? Forget it! It's stupid! And I took the test, and I still didn't get in, and finally, in 7th grade I got into that school, and it changed my life.

我在想,谁需要这所学校? 算了吧! 太傻了! 我参加了考试,但还是没考上,最后,在七年级的时候,我进了那所学校,这改变了我的生活。

I used every resource they had.

我利用了他们所有的资源。

I started new organizations.

我创立了新的组织。

I got funding from the principal of the school to start a model UN society, and I saw it in a different way, and I just seized the entire opportunity when I was there, because I knew how special it was, and I worked so hard to get there, and so, somehow, early on, that was one experience, but there were experiences like that, that I just learned that life is about hard work, and it's about lead bullets, and I'm always enamored by these real overnight successes.

我从校长那里得到了资金,开始了一个典型的联合国社会,我以不同的方式看到了它,我在那里抓住了所有的机会,因为我知道它有多么特别,我为达到这个社会而付出了巨大的努力,所以,不知何故,这是一个经历,但也有这样的经历,我刚认识到生活是关于艰苦工作的,这是关于铅弹的,我一夜之间总是迷恋这些成功。

I think the most overnight successes are like 10 years in the making.

我认为一夜之间取得的最大成功是十年的成功。

There are some flukes that are like one year, or two year, or three years, that the media celebrates in a disproportionate amount, and I'm always very enamored by them, but the only way that I know is this lead bullets, grit, do-not-give-up strategy.

有一些侥幸,就像是一年,两年,三年,媒体庆祝不成比例的数量,我总是非常迷恋他们,但我知道的唯一方法是这个铅弹,勇气,不放弃的策略。

\- You were a very ambitious 3rd grader.

\-你是一个雄心勃勃的三年级学生。

\- Thank you.

\-谢谢。

\- Kindergartner, too.

也是幼儿园的。

\- Thank you.

\-谢谢。

\- I wish we had known you back then. We would have just predicted all of this and funded you all the way back in kindergarten.

\-我希望那时我们就认识你了。 我们就会预测到这一切,并资助你们回到幼儿园。

\- That would have been great.

\-那太好了。

\- So, you talk about, obviously, never quitting, but do you think there are reasons to quit?

\-那么,很明显,你说的是从不放弃,但你认为有放弃的理由吗?

\-I guess I quit, kind of, on my first startup, and on one of the iterations of Gobble, and the only reasons I have ever quit is because I think what I was doing didn't have enough impact in the broader world, or fulfillment for me, and meaning and purpose for me.

\--我想我是在第一次创业的时候辞职的,在Gobble的一次迭代中辞职的,而我辞职的唯一原因是我认为我所做的事情在更广泛的世界里没有产生足够的影响,或者对我来说不够成功,对我来说也不够有意义,也不够有目的。

I thought about this question, and those are the only reasons I have quit in the past.

我想过这个问题,这是我过去辞职的唯一原因。

I think, though, that said, I think if the environment evolves, and you can't keep up with it, and things are just way surpassing you, then that would be a really hard look in the mirror, and I would may need to quit in that instance. So, not getting comfortable, and constantly iterating, and being not dogmatic is important. A good example of that is Netflix. Netflix evolved to stay alive.

我想,虽然这样说,我认为,如果环境演变,而你不能跟上它,而事情只是超越了你,那么这将是一个真正的困难的镜子,我可能需要退出,在这种情况下。 所以,不舒适,不断重复,不教条式是很重要的。 Netflix就是一个很好的例子。 Netflix进化到能活下来。

There are a lot of big titans of industry that fell along the way because they couldn't evolve.

有很多大的工业巨头,因为他们不能进化而一路下跌。

\- So, two more questions, and then we'll take questions from the audience. One is, when you look back, are there decisions that you made in the early days that you're thankful that you made, that were really critical to your success, and if so, what were they?

\-那么,再问两个问题,然后我们再回答观众的问题。 一种是,当你回头看时,你在早年所做的决定是否对你的成功至关重要,如果是的话,这些决定是什么?

\- Well, I'll talk about two. So, one of them is... A lot changed when we hired our executive chef, Thomas Ricci, and it wasn't just... We hired a chef to make consistent food, and good food, and safe food in a kitchen.

\-好吧,我说两个。 所以,其中一个是。。。 当我们聘请我们的行政总厨托马斯·里奇时,情况发生了很大变化,这不仅仅是。。。 我们雇了一个厨师在厨房里做稳定的食物,好的食物和安全的食物。

What we gained, though, was the ability to innovate in food, and what I have learned is, what I would suggest to an entrepreneur, is that real entrepreurship comes from diverse perspectives, and from innovating at the edge of different industries.

然而,我们所获得的是在食品方面的创新能力,而我所学到的是,我要向一个企业家建议的是,真正的企业家精神来自不同的视角,来自于不同行业的边缘的创新。

It's really hard just to get 10 homogenous engineers in a room, and make something incredible. You have to have other experts in consumer, or food, or something, whatever else is in your industry, to really find those little insights. So, our success came from innovating in technology and personalization, but a lot from innovating in food, and doing that prep work, and sending these food packages in a way that no other company sends them.

仅仅在一个房间里找10个同质工程师来制造一些令人难以置信的东西是很困难的。 你必须有其他的专家在消费者,或食品,或其他什么,无论在你的行业,真正找到这些小见解。 所以,我们的成功来自于技术和个性化的创新,但更多的是来自于食品的创新,准备工作,以及以其他公司无法提供的方式发送这些食品包。

That's not trivial. So, making room for creativity in different areas of your business is important, and we didn't have that creativity when the suppliers were just contractor chefs.

这可不是小事。 因此,在你的业务的不同领域为创造力腾出空间是很重要的,而当供应商仅仅是承包商厨师时,我们并没有这种创造力。

The second thing was, I have to thank Adora. She is way too humble. When I had no money, and I did YC, and I swallowed my pride, we were still doing that personalized dinner service, and somehow I got matched up with Adora, and we didn't even figure it out by demo day. We raised 200K on demo day.

第二件事是,我得谢谢阿多拉。 她太谦虚了。 当我没有钱,我做YC,我吞下了我的骄傲,我们仍然在做个性化的晚餐服务,不知何故,我得到了与阿多拉配对,我们甚至没有找到它的演示日。 我们在演示日筹到了200K。

It was nothing, 'cause it wasn't the right timing. We hadn't figured it out, and that we had just hired our chef, maybe six weeks or four weeks before demo day. So, I started working with him, and innovating with him, and focusing on our future, and meeting with Adora at her office, and anyways, I came to her, and I told her about this meal-kit idea, this 15-minute prep kit, back in 2014, and she was just so scary to me, and really badass, and really aggressive, and she was like, "Ooshma," and she was like, "If this is it, "you need to fucking do it," and she was like, "You need to do it now," and I was like, Okay, and she was like, "How fast can you do it?" and you kinda wanna impress people, so I'm like, I don't know, like two weeks, and she was like, "Great," and she was like, and so, I mean, she basically was like, she was like, she was like, it was, we had four weeks, so she was just like, it was in July, and I remember because it was August 1st, and she's like, "Do it by August 1st," and I was like, Okay, great, and I don't even know if she remembers all of that, but that's what I thought of every single day for 30 days, and I shut down that personalized dinner service, and we were doing, maybe, like one and a half to two million in ARR, but it wasn't going anywhere, and the food wasn't different enough, and when we had tested and R and D'ed these prep kits, where people cook it themselves, and feel like a superhero, that was magical in our testing and our customer visits. So, within 30 days, we just ripped the Band-Aid off, shut down that business.

没什么,因为时机不对。 我们还没想清楚,我们刚刚聘请了我们的厨师,也许在演示日之前六个星期或四个星期。 所以, 我开始和他合作, 和他一起创新,专注于我们的未来,在她的办公室和阿多拉见面,不管怎样,我来到她身边,我告诉她这个饭盒的想法,这个15分钟的准备套件,回到2014年,她对我来说是那么可怕,真的很坏,真的很好斗,她就像“Oshma”,她会说,“如果是这样,你就他妈的需要这样做,”。 你想给别人留下深刻印象, 所以我想, 我不知道, 就像两个星期, 她说, “太好了,” 她说, 所以, 我是说, 她基本上就像, 她说, 她说, 是的, 我们有四个星期, 所以她就像, 是在七月, 我记得因为那是八月一号, 她说, “在八月一号之前完成,” 我想,好吧,很好,我甚至不知道她是否记得所有这些,但这就是我30天以来每天的想法,我关闭了个性化的晚餐服务,我们在Arr做的事情,可能有一个半到两百万,但它没有走到任何地方,食物也不够不同,当我们测试和研究这些准备工具包,我们的人自己做饭,感觉和超级英雄。 所以,在30天内,我们就撕掉了创可贴,关闭了那家公司。

It was the highest revenue-making iteration that we had ever built. With every iteration we made more revenue, ultimately, even though we shut it down, and then, on August 3rd, we launched this thing, and I emailed Adora this long email of, here are the screenshots, here's this, and I was using her to hold myself accountable, and I was like, it's launched, and that was the best decision of our lives, and so just speed to execute, and the other lesson is finding people who are in your corner. You need people who are in your corner, and it's okay to not talk to the ones who aren't, but finding people who are in your corner, who you can use as an inspiration to motivate you, is really critical for speed.

这是我们创造的最高收益的迭代。 尽管我们每一次迭代都取得了更多的收益,最终,即使我们关闭了它,但是在8月3日,我们推出了这个东西,我给阿多拉发了一封这么长的邮件,这是截图,这是我用她来问责我自己,我就像,这是我们生命中最好的决定,这是我们执行的速度,而另一个教训是找到在你的角落里的人。 你需要站在你这边的人,不要和那些不站在你这边的人说话也没关系,但是找到那些站在你这边的人,你可以用他们来激励你,这对你的速度来说是非常重要的。

\- Cool, yeah, one of the things I tell people, just do it already. Do it.

\-很好,是的,我告诉别人的一件事,就是已经做了。 动手吧。

\- Yes. Exactly.

\-是的。 完全正确。

\- You have the idea. Stop, just stop middling. Just do it. Okay, so last question from me is, 50 to 100 years from now, Gobble is gonna be even bigger it is today, but what do you think it's gonna be?

\-你有主意了。 停下,停下。 就这么做。 好吧,我的最后一个问题是,50到100年后的今天,戈布尔会变得更大,但是你认为会是什么呢?

\- Wow, I... You know, in the 50 to 100-year vision, I actually want Gobble to be, let's call it the Disney of the home, and my thing with Gobble is about creating magical experiences at home that are easy and fit into this busy life, for any kind of person, single parents, hourly working, affluent people.

\-哇,我。。。 你知道,在50到100年的愿景中,我实际上想要Gobble成为,让我们称它为家里的迪斯尼,而我对Gobble的想法是,在家里创造一种神奇的体验,这种体验对于任何类型的人,单身父母,小时工作,富裕的人来说都很容易,也很适合这种繁忙的生活。

I think that with all this technology, and all this fast food, we've over-instrumented a lot of industries, and I was missing that connection, and I think at the end of the day, when our lives are over, all we care about are the moments with our loved ones, and so if I can facilitate some of that, whether it's with learning, whether it's with dinner or food, and I'll keep evolving with the environment, I think that's a worthy cause.

我认为,随着所有的技术和快餐,我们已经过度了许多行业,我错过了这种联系,我认为,最终,当我们的生命结束时,我们所关心的只是与我们所爱的人在一起的时刻,因此,如果我能帮助一些,无论是学习,无论是与晚餐或食物,我将保持与环境的发展,我认为这是一个值得的原因。

\- It's interesting. So, it's gonna be more than just food.

\-很有趣。 所以,这不仅仅是食物。

\- Yeah, we're working

\-是的,我们在工作

\- To my home.

\-去我家。

\- on a few other things around education, and learning, and things like that.

\-关于教育,学习之类的事情。

\- Awesome, cool. All right, so who has questions?

\-太棒了,酷。 好吧,那谁有问题?

\- [Audience Member] This question is both you guys. You talk about grit and determination, right? But besides that, you mentioned problems like people who are living here, have customers here, but are on, let's say, working visa, H-1B, stuff like that, right? They eventually rounded that legal hurdle, like you see them making progress, and they've clearly made progress, but now they're like, I don't know, what do I do with grit? Because I'm running into that problem, right? So, what kind of suggestion do you have for those people that are in that situation, and now they're like, shit, I just can't do anything about it now.

这个问题是你们两个。 你说的是勇气和决心,对吧? 但除此之外,你提到了一些问题,比如住在这里的人,这里有顾客,但是,我们可以说,工作签证,H-1B,诸如此类的问题,对吗? 他们最终突破了法律障碍,就像你看到他们在取得进展,而且他们已经取得了明显的进展,但现在他们就像,我不知道,我该如何处理勇气? 因为我遇到了那个问题,对吧? 那么,你对那些处于这种情况下的人有什么建议,现在他们就像,妈的,我现在什么也做不了。

I don't know what to do.

我不知道该怎么办。

\- Repeat the question.

\-重复这个问题。

\- Yeah, so I think the question is around that there are environmental constraints and legal constraints, with regards to immigration and H-1B, and things like that, that prevent people from being where they want to be with their customer, right?

\-是的,所以我想问题是,在移民和H-1B等问题上,存在着环境限制和法律限制,这会阻止人们去他们想去的地方,对吗?

\- [Audience Member] They've already been there, and now what do they do now? Like they have to do it full-time.

\-(观众)他们已经去过那里了,现在他们做什么呢? 好像他们要全职做一样。

They've reached the stage.

他们已经登台了。

\- If you have to do it full-time, but you have to live in another country, is that what you're asking?

\-如果你必须全职工作,但你必须住在另一个国家,这就是你想要的吗?

\- [Audience Member] You're already here. You have your customers here.

\-(观众)你已经到了。 你的客人来了。

There's no point in going back to where you came from.

回到你的家乡是没有意义的。

\- Oh yeah.

\-哦,是的。

\- [Audience Member] So, you are here. You made products on the side.

\-(观众)那么,你来了。 你在一边做产品。

The product is out, and you have your first customer, and now you've reached the point where you can't pull this thing off on the weekends or on the evenings. So, you have to do this full-time, but you can't. So, what do you do there? Grit and determination: what's the way out?

产品已经过时了,你有了第一个客户,现在你已经到了周末或晚上都不能把这件事搞定的地步了。 所以,你必须全职工作,但你不能。 你在那干什么? 勇气和决心:什么是出路?

\- Hmm, well, I know one of my good friends had a similar problem, and these are very tactical things.

\-嗯,我知道我的一个好朋友也有类似的问题,这些都是非常有策略的事情。

They established some shell company, and then one of the investors was put on as a board member, and then that board member sponsored the sponsorship, but you're really the CEO of the company, and so there are, I think, first of all, getting that H-1B visa is insane, right? And we have people who can't get that visa, so Gobble actually has an engineering team in India and in South Africa, and we're just waiting for the visas, and some people have been waiting for 14 months, and they're still working for us remotely. So, in those situations, that's nuts, and now there's very few loopholes, but if you already are here, sometimes there's some things you can do.

他们设立了一些空壳公司,然后一个投资者被任命为董事会成员,然后该董事会成员赞助,但你真的是公司的首席执行官,所以,我认为,首先,得到H-1B签证是疯狂的,对吗? 我们有很多人拿不到签证,所以Gobble实际上在印度和南非有一个工程队,我们只是在等签证,有些人等了14个月,他们还在远程为我们工作。 所以,在这些情况下,这是疯狂的,现在有很少的漏洞,但如果你已经在这里,有时有一些事情,你可以做。

I think YC has helped with some of that stuff.

我想YC帮了些忙。

\- If you're making revenue, and you have an actual company going, there's ways to go about it.

\--如果你在赚取收入,而你有一个真正的公司在经营,那就有办法做到这一点。

I would just talk with a lawyer.

我只想和律师谈谈。

\- Great.

\-太好了。

\- [Audience Member] Hi, thank you so much for coming and sharing with us.

\--(观众朋友)你好,非常感谢您的到来并与我们分享。

Talk a little bit about the pricing journey of Gobble.

谈一谈Gobble的定价过程。

I have a very successful offline business that I'm bringing online, and I'm scared, and I'm holding up because of pricing, so please inspire me and everyone else.

我有一个非常成功的离线业务,我带来了在线,我害怕,我坚持,因为价格,所以请激励我和其他人。

Tell us about your pricing strategy for Gobble.

跟我们说说你对戈布尔的定价策略。

\- Yeah, interesting. So, we've done a lot.

\-是的,有趣。 所以,我们做了很多。

\- Repeat the question.

\-重复这个问题。

\- Oh yeah, sorry. Question is: tell us about the pricing strategy for Gobble, and how our pricing strategy evolved. Pricing is a big part of product-market fit, so it has to be priced appropriately for your market.

\-哦,是的,抱歉。 问题是:请告诉我们Gobble的定价策略,以及我们的定价策略是如何演变的。 定价是产品市场的一个重要组成部分,因此它必须为你的市场定价合适。

Initially, we had different offerings at different prices on our marketplace.

最初,我们在市场上以不同的价格提供不同的产品。

If you're in a scrappy company, the best tool for pricing experimentation is email, because it's hard to put different prices all over your website for different users. So, what I would do is email people, and I have a zillion things in beta all the time. So, I'd email our existing customers, and I'd say, hey, here's a beta on premium dinners, or here's a beta on value meals, or here's a beta on our wine program, and I would first do all the research of the market, and then send people, different clusters of people, three different prices, and in the early days I did it with like 20 people each, and then now I do it with like thousands of people each. So, in the early days it was a plain text email, and I would say, like, would you, and then sometimes to each individual person I would send three plans.

如果你在一个短小精悍的公司,最好的定价实验工具是电子邮件,因为它很难把不同的价格遍布你的网站,为不同的用户。 所以,我要做的就是给别人发邮件,而且我在beta版里总是有无数的东西。 所以,我会给我们现有的顾客发邮件,我会说,嘿,这是高级晚餐的beta测试版,这是价值餐的beta测试版,这是我们葡萄酒项目的beta测试版,我会首先对市场进行所有的研究,然后发送给人,不同的人群,三种不同的价格,在早期,我和每个人都差不多有20个人在一起做,现在,我和成千上万的人在一起做。 所以,在早期,这是一个简单的短信邮件,我会说,就像,你,然后有时给每个人我会发送三个计划。

I'd say, do you want plan A, B, or C? And so that, you can send different groups different sets of three plans, or you can send different groups different pricing for one product, but I would... You just, basically, you multiply the profit times how many people buy it, and whichever one wins in most profit is your best price.

我会说,你想要A,B,还是C计划? 因此,你可以发送不同的组,不同的三组计划,或者你可以发送不同的组,不同的价格为一个产品,但我会。。。 你只是,基本上,你乘以利润乘以多少人购买它,无论谁赢得最大的利润是你最好的价格。

\- [Audience Member] Thank you.

谢谢你。

\- Right here.

\-就在这里。

\- [Audience Member] So, thank you for coming to talk to us today. YC is really pro having a cofounder, and you've done it on your own for a while, so can you talk about that?

\-(观众朋友)所以,谢谢你今天来和我们讲话。 YC真的很亲有一个共同创始人,你自己做了一段时间,所以你能说说吗?

\- The question is that YC is very pro having a cofounder, and that I did it on my own for a while, can I talk about that? Hmm, when I started Gobble, I looked for a cofounder, and I kinda just started it, like I found chefs on Craigslist, and I was delivering food in my car, but I was dating cofounders, that are now other YC founders, at the time, and no one at that time, in that three, four-month period was willing to quit their job and join me, or was randomly as passionate about my idea as I was, so it was a unique, this was all very organic.

\-问题是YC是非常专业的,有一个共同创始人,我自己做了一段时间,我能说说吗? 嗯,当我开始Gobble的时候,我找了一个联合创始人,我刚开始的时候,就好像我在Craigslist上找到了厨师,我在车里送食物一样,但是我在和联合创始人约会,他们现在是YC的其他创始人,当时没有人愿意辞职,在三,四个月的时间里,也没有人愿意加入我。

I didn't really think I must have a cofounder, or I must be a solo cofounder.

我真的不认为我必须有一个共同创始人,或者我必须是一个单独的共同创始人。

I tried to find one, and my priority was leaping on this idea, and so I didn't find one, and I just went with it. Long term, I think it is hard, very hard, as a single founder. Right now, our exec team operates kind of like as a hive mind, and I share everything with them. So, after many, many years, now we have like a five-person super-team that's all very invested, and kind of like a cofounding team, but at scale.

我试图找到一个,我的首要任务是跳到这个想法,所以我没有找到一个,我只是同意了。 从长远来看,我认为这很难,很难,作为一个单一的创始人。 现在,我们的高管团队就像蜂巢一样运作,我和他们分享一切。 所以,经过很多,很多年,我们现在有一个五人超级团队,都是非常投资,有点像一个共同成立的团队,但规模。

In the early days, what I say for single founders is, you kind of have, like if you're swimming in the ocean, it's kind of like a net/buoy system. So, you have to find like three or six people that are like those orange buoys, and you're swimming by yourself, and you're super-super-tired, and when you wanna rest, you swim over to one of the buoys, and you hug it, and you talk to them, and they help you, but then, since you don't have a cofounder, no one can be your rock, right? So, next time you need to rest, you swim over to another buoy, and you hug that, and you kinda like, you basically crowdsource your cofounder from other founders and friends, and you have to really find, and in fact, some of my closest friends were other single founders, and so I had a group of like two or three single founders, and we all would constantly meet up for coffee or drinks after work, and trade stories, and help each other.

在早期,我对单身创始人的说法是,你有一种,就像你在海洋中游泳,它就像一个网/浮标系统。 所以,你必须找到三,六个像那些橙色浮标一样的人,你自己游泳,你超级累,当你想休息,你游到其中一个浮标,你拥抱它,你和他们交谈,他们帮助你,但是,因为你没有一个共同创始人,没有人可以成为你的岩石,对吗? 所以,下次你需要休息的时候,你游到另一个浮标,你拥抱它,你喜欢,你基本上是从其他创始人和朋友那里找到你的共同创始人,你必须真正找到,事实上,我的一些最亲密的朋友是其他创始人,所以我有一群像两个或三个单身创始人,我们都会经常见面咖啡或饮料下班后,交易故事,并帮助对方。

\- Yes, right here.

\-是的,就在这里。

\- [Audience Member] How has your life changed as we see you now, versus when you started? What were the lows? What were the highs?

\-(观众)你的生活在我们现在看到你的时候发生了什么变化,和你刚开始的时候相比又发生了什么变化? 什么低点? 高点是多少?

\- Wow.

\-哇。

\- Here, I'll--

\-这里,我--

\- Please, I apologize.

\-拜托,我道歉。

\- So, the question is, how has your role as CEO changed from beginning to what it is now? Must have been dramatic.

那么,问题是,你作为CEO的角色从一开始到现在是怎样的变化? 一定很戏剧性。

\- Yes. Okay, in the beginning, one of the highs is just that you're constantly innovating.

\-是的。 好吧,一开始,一个高潮就是你在不断创新。

That 24/7 maker time is very precious to me. By contrast, now my day is like full of meetings.

每天24小时创造时间对我来说是非常宝贵的。 相比之下,现在我的日子就像是开会的日子。

It's like meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and then dinners, and so yesterday I get home at like 11:00 p.m., today we're staring at 8:00 a.m., and it's really full, and I have to fight for strategic time, and maker time, and we still need that to keep evolving, right? So, I cherish that part of the early days. Obviously, the lows are are when nobody cares about you. You barely have any customers.

就像是会议,会议,会议,会议,然后晚餐,所以昨天我晚上十一点到家,今天我们盯着早上八点,真的很忙,我要争取战略时间和制造时间,我们还需要这样才能不断发展,对吧? 所以,我很珍惜早期的那段时光。 很明显,当没有人关心你的时候,你的情绪就会低落。 你几乎没有顾客。

I'm just sleeping at our office, or laying on our couch, and I remembered in some of the lows, I just would put white paper all over, and I'd lay on the floor, and I'd just be like a blank slate, and I'd be like, okay, what's next? Come up with it. And so, those are the lows.

我只是睡在我们的办公室,或者躺在沙发上,我记得在一些低谷时,我会把白纸铺满,躺在地板上,就像一块空白的石板,然后我会说,好吧,接下来是什么? 想想办法。 所以,这些都是低谷。

The highs, now, are, it's really gratifying when people start to know you, and every time I meet a customer in the wild it makes my day, and when I get too far from the customer, I actually notice myself getting unhappy again.

现在的高潮是,当人们开始认识你时,我真的很高兴,每次我在野外遇到一个顾客,这让我很开心,当我离顾客太远的时候,我真的发现自己又变得不开心了。

I think, if you care about the customer and that experience long-term, all the money will come.

我想,如果你在乎客户和长期的体验,所有的钱都会来的。

\- Okay, let's take two more questions. One in the back.

\-好吧,我们再问两个问题。 后面一个。

\- [Audience Member] Yeah hi, my name is Shiraz, I'm the cofounder of Indiria, and one of my question is that in early stages you have to work with a lot of people, and how do you work with those people so that you have your sales, where you're getting the money from, but you also have people that work with you, and help your company grow? So, my question is, how do you get that happening without pestering them, like, hey,, hey,, but how do you do that in a good manner, and make them believe in your vision and work?

\--是的,嗨,我的名字叫Shiraz,我是Indiria的创始人之一,我的一个问题是,在早期阶段,你必须和很多人一起工作,你如何和这些人一起工作,这样你就有了你的销售,你从那里赚钱,但你也有和你一起工作的人,并帮助你的公司成长? 所以,我的问题是,你是如何在不缠着他们的情况下做到这一点的,比如,嘿,嘿,但是你如何以一种良好的方式做到这一点,并使他们相信你的远见和工作呢?

\- Yeah, that's great question.

\-是的,这是个好问题。

The question is, in the early days, you have I think the question is this: that you have your team that you're working with, and your customers, but there are other people that aren't on your team, that help you, and they're like mentors, advisors, friends. How do you get those people to work with you, without feeling like a pest, or that you're pestering them? I had a lot of this, so this is a really good question.

问题是,在早期,我认为问题是这样的:你有与你合作的团队,还有你的客户,但也有其他的人不在你的团队中,帮助你,他们就像导师,顾问,朋友。 你如何让这些人和你一起工作,而不觉得自己是一个害虫,或者你是缠着他们? 我有很多这样的问题,所以这是一个很好的问题。

Two things. One, I targeted the right advisors to help me, and I would find out where they were speaking, and I would wait till everybody was done talking to them, and be the last one to talk to the speaker, because they would remember me, and then I would walk them to their car, because they were in a rush. So, again, this is about psychology, and what does a speaker need to do? They've talked to 100 people.

两件事。 第一,我找对了顾问来帮助我,我会找出他们在哪里说话,我会等到每个人都跟他们说完话,我会是最后一个跟他们说话的人,因为他们会记得我,然后我会送他们到他们的车,因为他们赶时间。 所以,同样的,这是关于心理学的,一个演讲者需要做些什么呢? 他们已经和100个人谈过了。

They need to go.

他们得走了。

If you carry their bags to their car, you're helping them, in a small, little way, and you're showing kind of some respect there.

如果你把他们的包搬到他们的车里,你是在用一种微小的方式帮助他们,你是在表现出对他们的尊重。

That's how I found Aaron Patzer from Mint.com back in the day, who was one of my early advisors, and some other people.

这就是我当年从Mint.com找到Aaron Patzer的原因,他是我早期的顾问之一,还有其他一些人。

That was a hack to finding the right mentors, find out where they are, and wait, and then follow up.

这是一个黑客找到正确的导师,找出他们在哪里,并等待,然后跟进。

The other thing is, I only asked people questions that was in their wheelhouse. So, I learned a lot about, what should I ask this person? Because when you spend time with someone who's like a mentor, and let's say you ask me about enterprise sales.

另一件事是,我只是问了别人一些问题。 所以,我学到了很多,我应该问这个人什么? 因为当你花时间和一个像导师一样的人在一起,比如说你问我关于企业销售的问题。

I don't know anything about I know a little bit, but I don't know a lot about enterprise sales, and so it's kind of, it makes them feel bad, and it's also a waste of your time, and what I would do with people is I would bring I structured like a white piece of paper in three kind of thirds, I guess, and the top would be my progress, like what have I done since I last saw you? The next third would be, what am I working on now? And the last third would be, what are my challenges? And I was very organized about, all the time, that I asked from people, and so they always saw progress, and then they would see their advice come back, and I would save all my notes. So, in the early days, I met Reid Hoffman, and there was this cafe called University Cafe, and I went to cafes that only had paper tablecloths, and we would write all over the tablecloth, and then I would like take, it had coffee stains on it and stuff, and I would take it home, and I still have this box of those tablecloths that are like big butcher papers from like five, six years ago. So, it's just like, I think about all those little things, and about making time useful, taking notes, being prepared, and meeting with the right people.

我一点也不知道,但我对企业的销售情况不是很了解,所以这让他们觉得很糟糕,这也是在浪费你的时间,我要做的是,我会带一张三分之三的白纸给别人,我想,最重要的是我的进步,就像我上次见到你之后做的那样。 接下来的第三个问题是,我现在在做什么? 最后第三个问题是,我的挑战是什么? 我总是很有条理地询问别人,所以他们总是看到进步,然后他们会看到他们的建议回来,我会保存我所有的笔记。 所以,在早些时候,我遇见了里德霍夫曼,有一个叫大学咖啡馆,我去了一家只有纸桌布的咖啡店,我们会在所有的桌布上写字,然后我想要拿,上面有咖啡渍之类的东西,我会把它带回家,我还留着这盒像五,六年前大的屠夫纸一样的桌布。 所以,这就像是,我在想所有的小事,让时间变得有用,做笔记,做好准备,和合适的人见面。

\- I think, also, and you mentioned this, but I just wanna pull it out is being very thoughtful with the questions you ask, and being very specific, instead of asking broad questions that could take hours to answer.

\-我想,你也提过这个问题,但我想说的是,对你提出的问题要考虑得非常周到,而且要非常具体,而不是问那些可能需要几个小时才能回答的宽泛的问题。

\- Yes.

\-是的。

\- You're more likely to get an answer as a result. Okay, last question. Make it good. Guy in the back.

\-结果你更有可能得到答案。 好吧,最后一个问题。 让它变好。 后面那个。

\- [Audience Member] Hi, my name is Mark Rafael.

\-(观众朋友)你好,我叫马克。拉斐尔。

In fact, I was so eager to hear you today, I left my exhibitionto come here.

事实上,我今天很想听你的演讲,所以我离开了我的展览来到了这里。

\- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

\-天啊,太感谢你了。

\- [Audience Member] Question is about investors. Actually, you said that you struggled a lot to get investment at the very beginning. You gave us some hacks, how you get customers. You simply don't get mentors What do you do? Did you develop some strategy over time to get good investors?

\-(观众)问题是关于投资者的。 事实上,你说你一开始就努力争取投资。 你给了我们一些麻烦,你是如何得到顾客的。 你根本没有导师,你是做什么的? 随着时间的推移,你有没有制定一些策略来吸引好的投资者?

\- Wow, great question.

\-哇,问得好。

The question is, we talked about hacks with getting customers, and what are the hacks around getting investors, 'cause I struggled with getting investors in the early days.

问题是,我们讨论了如何吸引客户,以及如何吸引投资者,因为我在早期很难吸引到投资者。

I think, as you observe all your friends, everybody has lucky kind of easier fund-raising rounds, and everyone has hard fund-raising rounds. So, even if someone has it easy right now, and you have it hard, it's okay.

我想,当你观察你所有的朋友时,每个人都有一些幸运的,容易的筹款回合,每个人都有困难的筹款回合。 所以,即使有人现在很轻松,而你很难,也没关系。

It might be hard for them later, and the stories are very up and down. How do you get investors? Wow, it's still tough. For example, even last year, for our series B, I had a very difficult time raising money.

以后对他们来说可能会很难,而且故事也很起起伏伏。 你是怎么得到投资者的? 还是很难。 例如,即使在去年,我们的系列B,我有一个非常困难的时间筹集资金。

It all looks fantastic, and there's lots of news, and videos, but it took every ounce of my being.

这一切看起来都很棒,而且有很多新闻和视频,但它花费了我的每一分。

It was the hardest fund-raising, and it's because Amazon acquired Whole Foods, and everyone is afraid of Amazon, so they just thought Amazon's gonna do Gobble, and also because Blue Apron went public, and they don't have a lot of defensibility, and there's lots of companies that are repackaging groceries, so their stock price went down, and that meant that Gobble wasn't going to work. So, last year was really, really hard.

这是最难筹集的资金,因为亚马逊收购了全食公司,每个人都害怕亚马逊,所以他们以为亚马逊会公开收购,也因为蓝围裙上市了,他们没有太多的防御能力,还有很多公司重新包装食品,所以他们的股价下跌了,这意味着亚马逊不能再继续经营下去了。 所以,去年真的,真的很难。

What advice do I have? I think that... Oh, here's one good piece of advice: a lot of it is grit, and a lot of it is testing, and then watching what resonates with people, and perfecting your pitch, and it's weird to practice in front of friends, but you should really, really do it, and have everyone help you with your deck and your pitch.

我有什么建议? 我觉得。。。 哦,这里有一条很好的建议:很多是勇气,很多是考验,然后看着别人的共鸣,完善你的音高,在朋友面前练习是很奇怪的,但是你真的应该,真的应该做,让每个人帮你做你的牌和音高。

That's important, but the one advice I have, and this may not be true for everyone, but some founders that are shyer, or not as confident, when they get to their last slide, they say, even if, and they say, even if the world ends, I will still get you your money back, and investors do not care about getting their money back.

这很重要,但我有一条建议,也许对每个人都不是这样,但有些创业者,当他们走到最后一步时,他们说,即使世界末日,我还是会把你的钱拿回来,投资者也不在乎拿回来。

That is not sexy to them. You shouldn't say that. Founders are kind of like hedging against themselves, and saying, don't worry, I'll still protect your money, but you need to up-level that when you go talk to investors, and not say, even, if you need to say, you need to say that, we have the potential to be the next big X. We have the potential to be a $10 billion business in three years, and pump yourself up, stretch, power pose, but you have to end on that really big high note, very strong, and that's my piece of advice.

对他们来说不性感。 你不该这么说。 创业者就像是在对冲自己的风险,他们说,别担心,我还是会保护你的钱,但是你需要提高你的水平,当你和投资者谈话的时候,不要说,即使你需要说,我们有潜力成为下一个大公司,我们有潜力在三年内成为一个100亿美元的大公司,并且给自己一个充满活力,充满力量的姿态。
