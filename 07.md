# A Conversation with Ooshma Garg - Moderated by Adora Cheung

#与Ooshma Garg的对话 - 由Adora Cheung主持

- Thank you for coming today. My name's Adora. I'm one of the partners here at Y Combinator, and today we're gonna talk with, have a conversation with Ooshma Garg, who's the CEO and founder of Gobble, which creates and delivers 15-minute pan dinners to you. I am, personally, a happy customer. It's great for people who don't have time to do grocery shopping, prep ingredients, actually cook, and then clean up afterwards, so. So, Gobble started in 2011, and while it's doing pretty well today, it's growing around 100 million revenue per week, I believe. It's gone through its many ups and downs, and so with Ooshma today I wanted to talk to her about couple things. One is the evolution of her business. She's mostly been in the food business, but it's iterated her business model many times, and so I think it'd be interesting to talk about that, and then two is something she's an expert in, which is grit and determination. I think she's one of the few people that I've seen that just never gives up, and so I think grit and determination are one of the qualities many people think they have, but when shit hits the fan, things start to fall apart, and so I think it's also interesting to talk about. So, with that, I would love to welcome Ooshma to the stage. Thank you.

- 谢谢你今天来。我的名字是阿多拉。我是Y Combinator的合伙人之一,今天我们要与之交谈,与Oobma Garg进行对话,他是Gobble的首席执行官和创始人,为您创造和提供15分钟的晚餐。我个人是一个快乐的客户。对于那些没有时间做杂货购物,准备食材,实际做饭,然后清理的人来说,这是非常好的。因此,Gobble始于2011年,虽然今天表现相当不错,但我相信它每周的收入增长约1亿。它经历了很多起伏,今天和Ooshma一起,我想跟她谈谈几件事情。一个是她的业务发展。她主要从事食品业务,但它多次重复她的商业模式,所以我认为谈论这个很有意思,然后两个是她的专家,这是勇气和决心。我认为她是我见过的少数几个永不放弃的人之一,所以我认为勇气和决心是许多人认为他们拥有的品质之一,但是当狗屎袭击粉丝时,事情开始分崩离析,所以我认为谈论它也很有趣。所以,有了这个,我很乐意欢迎Ooshma到舞台。谢谢。

- [Ooshma] Thanks for having me.

-  [Ooshma]谢谢你拥有我。

- Thanks. So, welcome, Ooshma.

- 谢谢。所以,欢迎,Ooshma。

- Thank you for having me.

- 谢谢你拥有我。

- Thank you for coming. So, maybe we can just briefly start from the very beginning. You were a student at Stanford, and I believe you started your first company then, which was, correct me if I got this wrong, is you helped students get jobs at banks and other companies, so.

- 谢谢你的到来。所以,也许我们可以从一开始就简单地开始。你是斯坦福大学的一名学生,我相信你开始了你的第一家公司,如果我弄错了,请纠正我,你是否帮助学生在银行和其他公司找到工作,所以。

- Yes, yes.

- 是的是的。

- Obviously that didn't work out, and you did Gobble instead, but can you explain why that didn't work out, and what made you think that you should just move on from that idea.

- 显然这没有成功,你做了Gobble,但是你能解释为什么没有成功,是什么让你认为你应该继续这个想法。

- Sure. So, back when I was at Stanford, I started this company out of my dorm room, and a fun visual is that I had this like 150, 200-square-foot room with no space, and I lofted my bed like five inches from the ceiling, and stuffed some like IKEA desks under my bed. We could only fit like three desks in there. I was a junior, so I hired all these freshmen, really smart freshmen as interns, and got a boyfriend so I could sleep somewhere else, for the business, joking, and then our dorm room became our office, and I hid the key in the girls' bathroom, and people would come between class, and get the key from my pink shower caddy, and then go into my dorm room and work on our startup. So, that was our, that was my first company, Anapata, and the idea was to help students get jobs. I was head of this group, Stanford Women in Business, so we were matching people to banks, and law firms, and consulting firms, and I worked on that for three years. I bootstrapped it, and no one would fund me. They told me the idea was too niche, or what have you, but really, no one was using LinkedIn at the time, and all of these students are looking for work, so I thought that we could really be the LinkedIn for students, and it was all centered around their interests and student groups. Long story short, the idea was working, and we were making money. These companies would write us $20,000, $25,000 checks for annual subscriptions to my recruiting website, and it was a two-sided marketplace, so what really happened is, first of all, I poured everything I had into the business, and my health went down the drain, which later leads to Gobble, but what ended up happening is I learned the hard lesson that whoever pays you kind of owns you, and determines how your product evolves. So, theses banks, and consulting firms, and all of them, were paying me, and they wanted to recruit students based on quotas, based on like their GPA, or their race, or other parts of their background that didn't really have to do with if they were a good cultural match. So, anyways, I was making money, but the mission, and the initial vision, and all of that, of the business, of helping people find good jobs, wasn't true anymore. So, I actually got to a very dark place, and ended up selling the business. So, it could have worked, and it could have worked longer-term, but it wasn't the business I initially intended, and I'm not the kind of person who is just gonna do something to make money. I wanna do something that I believe in.

- 当然。所以,当我在斯坦福大学的时候,我从宿舍里开了这家公司,一个有趣的视觉效果就是我有150平方英尺的房间,没有空间,而且我放了五英寸的床。天花板,在我的床下塞满了宜家办公桌。我们只能在那里放三个办公桌。我是一名大三学生,所以我聘请了所有这些新生,非常聪明的新生作为实习生,还有一个男朋友,所以我可以睡在别的地方,为了生意,开玩笑,然后我们的宿舍成了我们的办公室,我把钥匙藏在里面女孩的卫生间,人们会来到课间,从我的粉红色淋浴球童拿到钥匙,然后进入我的宿舍,开始工作。那就是我们,这是我的第一家公司Anapata,其目的是帮助学生找到工作。我是斯坦福女性商业团队的负责人,因此我们将人们与银行,律师事务所和咨询公司进行了匹配,并且我在这方面工作了三年。我引导它,没有人会资助我。他们告诉我这个想法太利基了,或者你有什么,但实际上,当时没有人使用LinkedIn,所有这些学生都在寻找工作,所以我认为我们真的可以成为学生的LinkedIn,它全都围绕着他们的兴趣和学生团体。长话短说,这个想法很有效,我们赚钱了。这些公司会为我的招聘网站写入20,000美元,25,000美元的年度订阅支票,这是一个双面市场,所以真正发生的事情是,首先,我将我所拥有的一切都倾注到了业务中,我的健康状况下降了排水管,后来导致Gobble,但最终发生的事情是我学到了很多教训,无论谁付钱给你,都会拥有你,并决定你的产品如何发展。所以,这些银行,咨询公司以及所有这些公司都在付钱给我,他们希望根据他们的GPA,他们的种族或他们背景的其他部分,根据配额招募学生如果他们是一个很好的文化比赛。所以,无论如何,我赚钱,但是帮助人们找到好工作的使命,最初的愿景,以及所有这些,都不再是真实的。所以,我实际上到了一个非常黑暗的地方,最终卖掉了这个生意。所以,它可以起作用,而且可以长期运作,但这不是我最初想要的业务,而且我不是那种想要赚钱的人。我想做一些我相信的事情。

- Who did you sell it to?

- 你把它卖给了谁?

- So, in our third year, we were taking off with law firms. There are thousands of law firms, and only tens of banks on Wall Street, and so I sold it to a company called LawWorks, and basically they're a recruiting company and software, and they wanted to add community to their offering. At that time, it was like 2010, and social, and communities, and all of that, were not as common as they are now.

- 所以,在我们的第三年,我们与律师事务所一起起飞。华尔街有成千上万的律师事务所,只有几十家银行,因此我把它卖给了一家名为LawWorks的公司,基本上他们是招聘公司和软件,他们想在他们的产品中加入社区。当时,就像2010年一样,社会和社区以及所有这些都不像现在这么普遍。

- So, you mentioned, briefly, this is a good transition into, maybe talking about Gobble in the beginning. Your health was going down the drain. How did that actually turn into Gobble itself?

- 所以,你简单地提到,这是一个很好的过渡,也许在开始时谈论Gobble。你的健康状况正在下降。这实际上是如何变成Gobble本身的?

- Yeah. I'm sure, as you all are too familiar with, starting a company, at least, especially in the first 1,000 days, is very, very lonely. Very few people believe in the idea outside of yourself, and most people think you're crazy. Most people don't care about you, and so you're the only thing that keeps yourself going, and maybe your cofounder, your partner, but your partner's sick of hearing about it, and your cofounder may or may not work out, so there's lots of loneliness, and basically, this... I became just very insular. I stopped visiting my family and my friends. I was working on the business, but I was staying up too late, and then waking up too late, and then just eating like all this takeout, and soda, and I think it not only affects your physical health, and I gained a lot of weight, but it also affects your mental health. So, all of that came to a head when my dad insisted on visiting, and I was here in California. My parents are in Texas, and my dad is the head of nutrition at UT Southwestern in Texas, so he's spent 30 years of his life studying diabetes, obesity, and nutrition, and then, at home, he would make sure we all ate home-cooked food, and real good food, so, and your parents always know when something's wrong. You can't lie to them, so. So, it's just a matter of time, so. So, anyways, he got on a plane. Actually, first he cooked for three days, and made all of this home-cooked Indian food, stuffed it in these international suitcases that were nicely packed and checked in. Everything's in foil, and ziplocks, and whatever, flew here to California to my little dingy studio apartment, and without even saying hello, comes in the apartment, goes to the fridge, and starts stuffing the food in the fridge, and it just showed his anger, and sadness, and emotion about me not taking care of myself, and how bad things had gotten, and he warmed a little plate of some sabzi, which is a vegetable Indian dish, with some bread and rice, and just put it in front of me, and I had this IKEA two-person dining table in a corner, and I ate this first bite, and I just started crying uncontrollably because the food was so good, and it showed me how much I had lost, and it wasn't just nutrition, it was a sense of self and being, and that's really easy to do, and so anyways, that first bite of my dad's home cooking inspired Gobble, and that moment was when I decided that home cooking, and the sense of a family dinner, is very important to me.

- 是的我敢肯定,因为你们都太熟悉了,至少在创办公司时,特别是在最初的1000天里,非常非常孤独。很少有人相信自己以外的想法,大多数人都认为你疯了。大多数人不关心你,所以你是唯一一个让自己继续前进的人,也许是你的共同创始人,你的伴侣,但是你的伴侣厌倦了听到它,你的联合创始人可能会或可能不会工作,所以有很多孤独,基本上,这......我变得非常孤立。我不再访问我的家人和朋友。我正在做生意,但是我熬夜太晚了,然后太晚醒来,然后就像吃了这些外卖和苏打水一样,我认为它不仅影响你的身体健康,而且我获得了很多体重,但它也会影响你的心理健康。所以,当我父亲坚持要访问时,所有这一切都浮出水面,我在加利福尼亚州。我的父母在德克萨斯州,我的父亲是德克萨斯州UT西南大学的营养负责人,所以他花了30年的时间研究糖尿病,肥胖和营养,然后,在家里,他会确保我们都吃了家 - 烹饪食物,真正的美食,所以,你的父母总是知道什么时候出错了。你不能骗他们,所以。所以,这只是一个时间问题,所以。所以,无论如何,他上了飞机。实际上,他先煮了三天,然后把所有这些家常煮熟的印度食品塞进这些国际手提箱里,这些手提箱包装得很好并且检查完毕。所有的东西都用箔,拉链和其他什么,飞到加利福尼亚到我的小黑暗的工作室公寓,甚至没有打招呼,来到公寓,去冰箱,开始把食物塞进冰箱里,它只是表现出他的愤怒,悲伤和情绪,我不关心自己,事情变得多么糟糕了,他用一些蔬菜印度菜做了一小块sabzi,加了一些面包和米饭,然后把它放在我面前,我有一个宜家的双人餐桌。一个角落,我吃了第一口,我开始无法控制地哭,因为食物很好吃,它告诉我我失去了多少,这不仅仅是营养,它是一种自我和存在感,这真的很容易,所以无论如何,这是我父亲的家庭厨师的第一口鼓舞人心的Gobble,那一刻我决定家庭烹饪和家庭晚餐的感觉对我来说非常重要。

- So, the first version of Gobble, if I got it correctly, it was a marketplace for people to create home-cooked meals and sell it on the marketplace. So, that was 2011, and then, I believe, then, one year later, you turned it into, if I have this, I have it written down, catering.

- 所以,Gobble的第一个版本,如果我说得对,它就是人们创造家常饭并在市场上出售的市场。那么,那是2011年,然后,我相信,那么,一年后,你把它变成了,如果我有这个,我把它写下来,迎合。

- Yes.

- 是的

- And then, year later, it was personalized dinner service, and then, to what it is, pretty much what it is today,

- 然后,一年之后,它是个性化的晚餐服务,然后,它是什么,几乎是今天,

- Yes.

- 是的

- 10, 15-minutes dinner kits. So, maybe you could start off with, if you remember your one-liner for each four of those business models, to help us distinguish the difference between those four.

-  10分钟,15分钟的晚餐套餐。所以,也许你可以开始,如果你还记得每个商业模式中的每一个的单行代码,以帮助我们区分这四种商业模式之间的差异。

- Absolutely. I definitely remember the first one, because it's what I raised our seed round off of. So, we started, after I ate that food, I wanted to replicate my dad in the Bay Area, and I posted on Craigslist, and looked for moms or dads that would cook for me. Anyway, the way that we described the idea, it ultimately became a marketplace for personal chefs and families, and we described it as peer-to-peer lasagne, and everyone remembered that, and just said it, and it was catchy, and weird, and the peer-to-peer economy was really hot at the time. Airbnb was just coming up. Etsy was coming up, and there were all these rental or sharing startups in 2010 to 2012. So, that's how we described the marketplace. Catering was just like home-cooked food for office. The personalized dinner service was exactly that. It was meals, personalized exactly to your tastes, and our current dinner kits, we describe as, just as a meal-prep service, 15-minute, one-pan cooking.

- 绝对。我绝对记得第一个,因为这是我提出的种子。所以,我们开始吃完食物之后,我想在湾区复制我的父亲,然后我在Craigslist上发帖,寻找能为我做饭的妈妈或爸爸。无论如何,我们描述这个想法的方式,它最终成为个人厨师和家庭的市场,我们把它描述为点对点烤宽面条,每个人都记得那个,只是说,而且它很吸引人,而且很奇怪当时的点对点经济非常火爆。 Airbnb刚刚上映。 Etsy即将到来,2010年至2012年期间,所有这些租赁或分享初创公司都是如此。所以,这就是我们描述市场的方式。餐饮就像家常熟食一样。个性化的晚餐服务就是这样。这是根据您的口味进行个性化的膳食,以及我们目前的晚餐套餐,我们将其描述为15分钟的单锅烹饪。

- So, everyone who built a product always remembers their very first user who wasn't their mom, or dad, or family. Do you remember that person, and what was he or she like?

- 所以,每个制作产品的人都会记得他们的第一个用户不是他们的妈妈,爸爸或家人。你还记得那个人,他或她喜欢什么?

- Yeah. So, recently I met one of our very first like 10 users. The guy's name is Shealtiel, and it's really funny. I actually met him, and he was a user of ours in 2011. So, now it's some seven, eight years later. I met him a few weeks ago at a wedding in New York, and he was like, "Are you Ooshma?" I was like, Yeah. And he was like, "I used to eat your food." And your product goes through so many iterations that when someone remembers the first website of yours, and all those bugs and things, it's really special. He was a Stanford student, and he would email us pages of feedback every time he tried the food, and so it was kind of the canonical early adopter, that someone who really wants to work with you, and who wants to help improve your company, and make it good for them and for everybody else.

- 是的所以,最近我遇到了第一个像10个用户之一。这个人的名字是Shealtiel,这真的很有趣。我实际上遇到了他,并且他在2011年是我们的用户。所以,现在是七,八年后。几周前我在纽约的一场婚礼上遇见了他,他就像是,“你是Ooshma吗?”我当时想,是的。他就像是,“我曾经吃过你的食物。”而且你的产品经历了如此多的迭代,当有人记得你的第一个网站,以及所有这些bug和东西时,它真的很特别。他是斯坦福大学的学生,每当他尝试食物时,他都会给我们发送反馈意见,所以这是一个规范的早期采用者,一个真正想与你合作,想要帮助改善你公司的人,使它对他们和其他人都有好处。

- So, in the beginning, you also did a lot of unscalable things to get users. I read you did promo cars everywhere. You went to Starbucks and, I guess, bothered people

- 所以,在开始时,你也做了很多不可扩展的事情来吸引用户。我看到你到处都做过促销车。你去了星巴克,我猜,困扰了人们

- Yes, yes.

- 是的是的。

- To order from Gobble. So, a lot of those things probably didn't work, but anything that you remember that actually worked.

- 从Gobble订购所以,很多这些东西可能不起作用,但你记得的任何东西都有效。

- Yeah. There are two things that worked, and I was reflecting on this. One of them is, I guess, the things that work is, when you're just starting out, you can't throw a million dollars into Facebook ads in one week, but it doesn't also work to just talk to 10 individuals. That's too unscalable. So, it's all about reaching microgroups. One thing I did is, I would go to my fave, I went to all my favorite shops, like coffee shops, restaurants, laundromats, whatever, and I actually bought card holders on like a whatever, equipment website, and made promo cards that were business-card size, and it said, like, two free dinners, Gobble.com, and it had the restaurant's name on the back. One of the first valuable innovations, or features, that we released into our product was the ability to accept promo codes, because attribution of your growth is extremely important from day one, or else I can't tell you what's working or not working. So, there's ZombieRunners on California Avenue, it's this coffee shop, and it's inside a running store, that used to be a movie theater. It's very weird. You should go there. It's my favorite coffee shop, and so, they put a little thing at their register, and it turned out to be more effective than the nail salons, the laundromats, anything else. Another YC company order-ahead, actually, for a while, was very successful with coffee shops, and promos, and ordering at coffee shops. One other thing was, I spoke to as many meetup groups, or moms groups, and neighborhood groups, as possible, and I would get them, I would always try to have an offer that was, I tested offers, and I knew what would work, so every single one of them would send my offer on their email list, and it had to be an email with your offer to a group, and that converted.

- 是的有两件事是有效的,我正在思考这个问题。其中一个是,我猜,有用的东西,当你刚刚开始时,你不能在一周内投入一百万美元到Facebook广告中,但它也不能与10个人交谈。这太不可扩展了。所以,一切都是为了达到微型群。我做的一件事是,我会去我的最爱​​,我去了所有我最喜欢的商店,如咖啡店,餐馆,自助洗衣店,等等,我实际上像任何设备网站一样买了持卡人,并制作促销卡,这是两张免费的晚餐,Gobble.com,它背面有餐厅的名字。我们发布到产品中的第一个有价值的创新或功能之一就是能够接受促销代码,因为从第一天开始,您的增长归因非常重要,否则我无法告诉您哪些有效或无效。所以,加利福尼亚大道上有ZombieRunners,它就是这家咖啡店,而且它位于一家经营的商店里,曾经是一家电影院。这很奇怪。你应该去那里。这是我最喜欢的咖啡店,因此,他们在他们的寄存处放了一个小东西,结果证明它比钉子沙龙,自助洗衣店,其他任何东西都更有效。实际上,另一家YC公司提前订购,在咖啡店,咖啡店和咖啡店订购时非常成功。另一件事是,我和尽可能多的聚会团体,妈妈团体和社区团体进行了交谈,我会得到它们,我总是会尝试提供一个,我测试了优惠,我知道什么会工作,所以他们每个人都会在他们的电子邮件列表上发送我的报价,它必须是一个电子邮件,其中包含您对某个组的报价,并且已转换。

- The attribution point is very, I think, key there, which is, even if you're doing a spray-and-pray method of just like, everyone use me, at least you know, when they come in the door, where they actually thought of you.

- 我认为归属点非常关键,就是说,即使你正在做一个喷雾和祈祷的方法,每个人都会使用我,至少你知道,当他们进门时,他们实际上想到了你。

- Absolutely, yes.

- 绝对没错。

- Cool. So, again, and going back to the evolution of the business, at what point in each of the business models did you realize, oh, this isn't it, I gotta think of something else?

- 很酷。那么,再一次,回到业务的演变,你在每个商业模式的哪个点上意识到,哦,这不是它,我还想到别的什么?

- Right. The funny thing is that, and so first of all, we talked about these business models. All of that was going on from 2011 to 2014. So, between three and a half years, which is still roughly that 1,000 days of finding product-market fit, we had four different iterations to the product, and this is a minor little point, but I know that, I think Michael Seibel spoke recently, and he said that, he talked about the difference between pivoting and iterating, and I thought that was really important, because people say Gobble pivoted, but we didn't pivot. We didn't turn into some online video game. We just iterated, and then found success. So, I think that nuance is important, because pivoting, I think, you don't carry a lot of your learnings with you. Iterating is always building on your previous learnings. So, with these business models, and different iterations and launches, they all failed for different reasons. We had a marketplace first, and everyone loved the food, because it was this authentic, small-batch, home-cooked food from real people: Italian grandmas, and Mexican moms, and Ethiopian chefs, and things, and food you can't get anywhere else, that's not ruined by capitalism, I guess. Anyways, that food wasn't scalable. So, we started getting success with that marketplace idea, but when I asked this Italian mom in San Carlos to make me 200 of her lasagne, when she used to make 20 a day, it wasn't fun anymore, and she didn't wanna make 200, and she wasn't a caterer. So, that model... Airbnb is a peer-to-peer model that can scale, and it's sharing an asset. It's sharing a space. This is a peer-to-peer model that has a lot of breakpoints at scale, of quality, time, capacity, and so on. So, that's why the marketplace model didn't work. We were supply-constrained, not by the number of chefs, but by the juice we could squeeze from each of our SKUs on the marketplace. Then we pivoted to catering, because we had built that marketplace with seed funding, and we maybe had like a half a year of money left, or something, but one of our investors was very insistent that we pad our growth with money, and we do something that'll definitely make us money, and so I went into the catering world. Frankly, to me, I think it's very easy, and I didn't really want to do it. You just get, we got Box.net, and Pinterest, and these companies signed on, and they rarely quit, and so you're just making this money in the background. We did that. We made good money, and we showed growth, but the problem is that when we went to raise series A, the investors asked, how much of your money is from families, and the model you're pitching, and how much of your money is from catering and from enterprise? And at that point, some 75% was from enterprise, because when you do something like that, like the previous startup lesson we learned, all your attention goes to what's giving you the most money, and so that really sucked, because unless I wanted to build a catering business, then I wasn't gonna get funding. So, we were in a pinch then, and I had to raise a bridge round, and wind down the catering business, which was hugely unpopular, because we were making lots of money, but it wasn't my long-term vision. The vision was that people don't have access to this home-cooked food, and I wanted to crack it, and figure it out, and give it to everyone. So, we wound that down because it wasn't part of the long-term vision. So, then we focused on this personalized dinner service. I still, today, think that the power of personalization, what Amazon brings to e-commerce, and what Netflix and Spotify bring to movies and music, that level of personalization has not taken off in food, and just like Google, with search, the company that cracks it in food, I think, will be the long-term winner, and have all these learnings built on top of each other, to where you build a long-term, sustainable advantage. So, that's what we did with that personalized dinner service. We took these chefs, and then we started using restaurants, and caterers, and we focused on the technology, because that's the talent that we had in our headquarters. We had engineers, and product people. So, we focused on the tech to match, to take, we allowed people to give us whatever taste they wanted, so we ended up getting thousands of picky eaters, and people who didn't eat nightshades, and they were vegan, but they still didn't likes olives, and lettuce, and crazy stuff, and no matter what your tastes were, I said I would feed you, and so anyway, that model really stretched our technology, and by doing the hard thing, we learned.

- 对。有趣的是,首先,我们谈到了这些商业模式。所有这一切都是从2011年到2014年进行的。因此,在三年半之间,这仍然是大约1000天的产品市场契合度,我们对产品进行了四次不同的迭代,这只是一个小小的一点但我知道,我认为Michael Seibel最近发表了讲话,他说,他谈到了旋转和迭代之间的区别,我认为这非常重要,因为人们说Gobble转向,但我们没有转动。我们没有变成一些在线视频游戏。我们只是迭代,然后找到了成功。所以,我认为这种细微差别非常重要,因为我认为你不会带着很多学到的东西。迭代始终建立在您以前的学习上。因此,通过这些业务模型,以及不同的迭代和启动,它们都因各种原因而失败。我们首先拥有一个市场,每个人都喜欢这里的食物,因为这是来自真人的这种正宗的,小批量的自制食品:意大利奶奶,墨西哥妈妈,埃塞俄比亚厨师,东西和食物,你不能我想,到达其他任何地方,都不会被资本主义所破坏。无论如何,食物不可扩展。所以,我们开始用这个市场的想法取得成功,但是当我问这位意大利妈妈在圣卡洛斯给我200个她的烤宽面条时,她过去常常每天做20次,这不再有趣了,她没有想要200,她不是一个餐饮服务商。那么,那个模型...... Airbnb是一个可以扩展的点对点模型,它正在共享资产。它正在共享一个空间。这是一种点对点模型,在规模,质量,时间,容量等方面都有很多断点。所以,这就是市场模式不起作用的原因。我们供应受限,不是由厨师的数量,而是我们可以从市场上的每个SKU挤出的果汁。然后我们转向餐饮,因为我们用种子资金建立了这个市场,我们可能还有半年的资金,或者其他什么,但我们的一个投资者非常坚持我们用钱来填补我们的增长,而我们做一些肯定会让我们赚钱的事情,所以我进入了餐饮界。坦率地说,对我而言,我觉得这很容易,我真的不想这样做。你得到的,我们有Box.net和Pinterest,这些公司签约,他们很少退出,所以你只是在后台赚钱。我们做到了。我们赚了很多钱,而且我们显示了增长,但问题是,当我们去筹集A系列时,投资者问,你的钱是多少来自家庭,你投的模型,以及你的钱多少来自餐饮和企业?在那一点上,大约75%来自企业,因为当你做这样的事情时,就像我们之前学到的创业课一样,你所有的注意力都集中在给你最多钱的东西上,所以真的很糟糕,因为除非我想要建立一个餐饮企业,然后我不会得到资金。那么,我们当时处于紧张状态,我不得不筹集一座桥梁,并放弃了餐饮业务,这非常不受欢迎,因为我们赚了很多钱,但这不是我的长期愿景。我们的愿景是,人们无法获得这种自制食物,我想破解它,弄清楚它,然后把它交给每个人。所以,我们伤害了它,因为它不是长期愿景的一部分。那么,我们专注于这种个性化的晚餐服务。今天,我仍然认为,个性化的力量,亚马逊为电子商务带来的东西,以及Netflix和Spotify为电影和音乐带来的东西,个性化的水平并没有在食物中发挥作用,就像Google一样,通过搜索,我认为,在食品中破裂的公司将是长期的赢家,并将所有这些学习建立在彼此之上,以及建立长期,可持续优势的地方。所以,这就是我们用这种个性化的晚餐服务所做的。我们带了这些厨师,然后我们开始使用餐馆和餐饮服务商,我们专注于技术,因为这是我们在总部的才能。我们有工程师和产品人员。因此,我们专注于匹配,采取的技术,我们允许人们给我们任何他们想要的味道,所以我们最终得到成千上万的挑食者,没有吃夜莺的人,他们是素食主义者,但他们仍然不喜欢橄榄,生菜和疯狂的东西,无论你的口味如何,我说我会喂你,所以无论如何,这种模式真的拉伸了我们的技术,并通过努力,我们学到了。

- If you're a vegan and don't like lettuce, what are you eating?

- 如果你是素食主义者,不喜欢生菜,你在吃什么?

- I know. I don't know. Like, lots of beans.

- 我知道。我不知道。就像,很多豆子。

- So, you moved the business model a little bit each time, or quite a bit, actually, each time

- 所以,每次都会将业务模型稍微移动一点,或者实际上每次移动一点点

- Yes.

- 是的

- and so one of the difficult things in doing that is taking the risk, and bringing down your current business for, hopefully, future success, and that, I think, a lot of people actually don't do that because it's very, very scary. They just try keep pushing the current model, trying to make it work. So, was it scary for you, and what was your thought process in actually just saying, no, not gonna do this enterprise catering anymore, even though it's making me tons of money?

- 所以这样做的困难之一就是承担风险,降低你当前的业务,希望未来的成功,而且,我认为,很多人实际上并不这样做,因为它非常非常害怕。他们只是尝试继续推动当前的模型,试图让它工作。那么,这对你来说是多么可怕,你的想法过程实际上只是说,不,不会再做这个企业餐饮,即使它让我赚了很多钱?

- Right, right, it was so scary. It was really scary, and actually, some of our investors would call me into their office, and just use it as, like, me as a punching bag, and sit down at their reclaimed wood table in their kitchenette or something, and they would like, I'd be sitting, and I'd stand up, and they'd be like, and every time there's new startups coming up, the grass is always greener, because the investors know all your problems, and they don't know any of the other problems. So, anyway, so they would be like, "This company, Munchery, is starting, "and this company, OrderAhead, is starting, "and all these companies are starting, "and what are you doing?" and it was much louder, and much worse than that, and so, but you know? I have found, I think that's what you mentioned earlier, about the grit and determination. I don't know if it's learned, or what it is. Over so many years, I have found that I cannot listen to anything, there's nothing more loud than my gut, and it just, when you know something, and you've been in it for three years, or thousands of days, you can't avoid it. You know what you have to do. Other people think about you like 1% of the year, and just in the one-hour meeting, and so I think early on we put a lot of weight into investor meetings, even into YC partner meetings, into all these meetings, and it can really throw you off your game for a few days. You're like, ugh, this one person didn't like my idea. Who am I? And it's just something you have to get through, and I would always try to justify each direction with logic, and with market drawings, and one book that really helped me was Blue Ocean Strategy. It's my favorite business book to date, and it talks about how companies broke through the noise in existing industries. Talks about Southwest Airlines, Yellowtail wine, and some really interesting companies that no one thought would work, and it gives you a framework with which to think about your company, and I would draw that framework, and keep using it as my north star.

- 对,对,这太吓人了。这真的很吓人,实际上,我们的一些投资者会叫我进他们的办公室,只是用它作为一个出气筒,坐在他们的小厨房或其他东西的再生木桌上,他们会就像,我会坐着,我会站起来,他们会像,每当有新的创业公司出现时,草总是更环保,因为投资者知道你所有的问题,他们不会知道任何其他问题。所以,无论如何,所以他们会说,“这家公司,Munchery,正在开始,”这家公司,OrderAhead,正在开始,“所有这些公司都在开始,”你在做什么?“而且声音更响亮更糟糕的是,所以,但是你知道吗?我发现,我认为这就是你之前提到过的,关于勇气和决心。我不知道它是学到了,还是它是什么。这么多年了,我发现我听不到任何东西,没有什么比我的直觉更响亮,只是,当你知道什么,而你已经进入它三年,或几千天,你无法避免它你知道你必须做什么。其他人一年中有1%想到你,而且只是在一小时的会议中,所以我想我们很早就投入了大量的投资者会议,甚至是YC的合作伙伴会议,进入所有这些会议,它真的可以让你离开你的游戏几天。你喜欢,呃,这个人不喜欢我的想法。我是谁?这只是一些事情你必须通过,我总是试图用逻辑和市场图纸证明每个方向,并且一本真正帮助我的书是蓝海战略。这是我迄今为止最喜欢的商业书籍,它讲述了公司如何突破现有行业的噪音。谈论西南航空公司,Yellowtail葡萄酒,以及一些没有人认为会有用的真正有趣的公司,它给你一个框架来考虑你的公司,我会画出这个框架,并继续使用它作为我的北极星。

- In a previous talk, and let me read this so I get it right, you said something pretty insightful, which is, "Product market fit is not just an a-ha moment. "It's the summation of lots of broad experiments "and micro-learnings over many years." Can you briefly expand on that? A common mistake is for people, when they look at product-market fit, is to just look at one metric, and then, if it moves in one direction, then that's good. So, what did you look at the beginning in? How did you visualize this summation of stuff?

- 在之前的演讲中,让我读一读,所以我说得对,你说了一些非常有见地的东西,“产品市场契合不仅仅是一个时刻。”这是许多广泛实验的总和“和多年的微观学习。“你能简单介绍一下吗?一个常见的错误是,当人们看到产品市场契合时,只要看一个指标,然后,如果它朝一个方向移动,那么那就好了。那么,你从一开始就看到了什么?你是如何形象化这些东西的总和的?

- Yeah. Ultimately, I think that product-market fit is the center of the Venn diagram of ability to grow, on one side, and retention, on the other side, and so, if you look at our history, in the marketplace model we weren't able to grow because of the chefs. We were supply-constrained. In the personalized dinner model, we actually weren't able to grow really fast because of the customers. Even though it was personalized, the food wasn't better than the best takeout that you could order. So, if you wanna change the world, or change your industry, you have to do something that is materially better, like iPhone-level better than the market. So, people weren't racing to our door, so we didn't have that ability to grow. Our dinner-kit model has the ability to grow and scale, internally and externally, from customer demand, and it also has high retention.

- 是的最终,我认为产品市场契合度是维恩图的核心,一方面是增长的能力,另一方面是保留,所以,如果你看一下我们的历史,那么在市场模型中,我们就是&#39;能够因为厨师而成长。我们受供应限制。在个性化的晚餐模式中,由于客户,我们实际上无法快速增长。即使它是个性化的,食物并不比你可以订购的最佳外卖更好。所以,如果你想改变世界,或改变你的行业,你必须做一些实质上更好的事情,比如iPhone更好的市场。所以,人们没有竞争到我们的门,所以我们没有这种成长的能力。我们的餐具套装模型能够根据客户需求在内部和外部进行扩展和扩展,并且具有很高的保留率。

- So, moving on to, maybe, more about grit and determination. So, in the beginning, at Stanford you were a bioengineering major,

- 所以,继续,或许,更多关于勇气和决心。所以,一开始,在斯坦福大学,你是一名生物工程专业,

- Yes.

- 是的

- so technical, but not a coder. How did you manage actually doing all of this without being technical?

- 技术性,但不是编码员。你是如何在没有技术的情况下管理所有这一切的?

- Yes. Hmm. Well, initially, and everyone is gonna use their skill sets, and I think the one common theme is that, in the first few months you need to prove your concept. You need to have an MVP. You can do that with code. You can do that with sales, whatever. So, I did not know how to code. I learned PHP, but in both my businesses, in the recruiting business and the chef business, or the food business I have now, I made initial sales without a website, and I proved our concept in the first three months, before any other kind of funding. So, with the recruiting business, I did know like Photoshop and design, and I taught myself all of that, and loved it, so I enjoyed that, and I designed these sales packages that would, like, and I made up stuff. I was like gold, platinum, whatever, $20,000, and I would see if people would give it to me, which is very bold, as a college student, and I had a mockup of a website that wasn't built yet, and I took a semester off, and tried, and only did sales, because that was my proof of concept, and my parents said that only if I got a sale could I not go work on Wall Street, which was horrible. So, side note, I didn't get a sale that semester, and I met like maybe 80 or so people through introductions, and I went to go work at Morgan Stanley in 2008, and that horrible summer, and I hated my life. It was like equities trading, and three weeks in, I got a check in the mail for $10,000, 'cause it was the founding customer price from this law firm, and it was like the coolest day of my life. It was revenue. It was validation, and it took me like seven to 10 days to figure out how to quit the internship. People were all like, you'll get blacklisted. You'll never get a job, and I told the head of the program, and he said, you will always have a job here, but you will never come back, and I thought that was weird at the time, and now I fully understand it, and it's because, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, in your heart, in a way. So, anyways, I think the quitting is hard. So, long story short, but it's hard to avoid.

- 是的嗯。好吧,最初,每个人都会使用他们的技能,我认为一个共同的主题是,在最初几个月你需要证明你的概念。你需要一个MVP。你可以用代码做到这一点。无论如何,你可以用销售做到这一点。所以,我不知道如何编码。我学习了PHP,但在我的业务,​​招聘业务和厨师业务,或者我现在的食品业务中,我在没有网站的情况下进行了初步销售,我在前三个月证明了我们的概念,在任何其他类型之前资金。所以,通过招聘业务,我确实知道像Photoshop和设计,我自学了所有这些,并喜欢它,所以我很喜欢,我设计了这些销售包,我喜欢和我编造的东西。我就像金,白金,无论如何,2万美元,我会看到人们是否会把它给我,这是非常大胆的,作为一名大学生,我有一个尚未建成的网站的模型,我花了一个学期,尝试了,只做了销售,因为这是我的概念证明,我的父母说,只有我买了一笔,才能在华尔街上工作,这太可怕了。所以,请注意,那个学期我没有买单,我通过介绍会见了大约80人左右,2008年我去了摩根士丹利工作,那个可怕的夏天,我讨厌我的生活。这就像股票交易,三个星期后,我收到10,000美元的邮件支票,因为它是这家律师事务所的创始客户价格,这就像我生命中最酷的一天。这是收入。这是验证,我花了7到10天才弄清楚如何退出实习。人们都喜欢,你会被列入黑名单。你永远找不到工作,我告诉程序负责人,他说,你将永远在这里找到一份工作,但你永远不会回来,我认为当时很奇怪,现在我完全理解它,这是因为,曾经是一个企业家,永远是一个企业家,在你的心中,在某种程度上。所以,无论如何,我认为戒烟很难。所以,长话短说,但很难避免。

- So, around 2011, 2014, you had a hard time raising money, correct? So, how did you, I mean, it's three years. How did you fund all of this, and then also, at the same time, what did you spend your days doing? You must have been really... When you can't get money, that's a huge distraction, so how did you focus on your business and keep going?

- 那么,在2011年,2014年左右,你很难筹集资金,对吗?所以,你是怎么做的,我的意思是,这是三年。你是如何资助所有这些的,然后同时也是你花了多少时间做的?你一定是真的...当你无法获得金钱时,这是一个巨大的分心,所以你是如何专注于你的业务并继续前进的?

- Yes. So, first of all, over those three and a half years of finding product-market fit, our monthly burn was $40,000, on average. That's pretty low. That's not a fancy office. That's not 10 people. We kept it to about four people, and everyone had to be like cofounder-style generalist, because we were still iterating. So, if you make your burn 40K, you can make your 1.5 million last a while, but we raised two bridge rounds during that time, and there were some investors who refused to invest, some of them who would listen to the next iteration, and invest in me. Both of those bridges were like 200-some K, and one critical thing: there was a time, in 2013, when no one would invest in me, and I was running out of all of my money, and we had like one payroll in the bank. I think our bank was like $8,000 or something, and that's when I did YC. So, I didn't do YC at the beginning of Gobble. I did YC three and a half years into the struggle, when I was, I didn't know I was about to figure it out. Everybody had lost faith, and I'm the only one who had faith, and the only money I could get was from Jessica and P. G., and so I did YC, and they said they would help me raise a series A, they would fund me for three more months, and six months after that, we figured out our 15-minute one-pan dinner kit.

- 是的因此,首先,在三年半的时间内,我们发现产品市场合适,我们每月的平均烧伤费用为40,000美元。那个很低。那不是一个奇特的办公室。那不是10个人。我们保留了大约四个人,每个人都必须像联合创始人式的通才一样,因为我们还在迭代。所以,如果你让你的燃烧40K,你可以让你的150万持续一段时间,但我们在那段时间内筹集了两轮桥梁,并且有一些投资者拒绝投资,其中一些人会听下一次迭代,并投资于我。这两座桥梁都像是200-K,还有一件至关重要的事情:有一段时间,在2013年,没有人会投资我,而且我的所有资金都用尽了,而且我们有一个工资单银行。我认为我们的银行就像8,000美元或者其他什么东西,那就是我做YC的时候。所以,我没有在Gobble的开头做YC。我做了YC三年半的斗争,当我的时候,我不知道我准备解决这个问题。每个人都失去了信心,我是唯一一个有信仰的人,我唯一可以得到的钱来自杰西卡和PG,所以我做了YC,他们说他们会帮助我筹集A系列,他们会资助我再过三个月,六个月后,我们想出了我们15分钟的一锅晚餐套餐。

- So, you mentioned you had employees during this hard time. How did you keep them motivated to keep going?

- 所以,你提到你在这困难时期有雇员。你是如何保持他们继续前进的?

- Mm, that's a tough one. I think that there's a lot of turnover in the early days, and even in the later days, after venture financing, and you're learning how to hire execs, but the employees that ended up lasting the longest were by referral, and so there was some shared values, and shared trust there, and I also really clued them into the hard times. Sometimes you think you're protecting people by not telling them, but actually, your closest employees, especially when you're four to six, if you bring them into the challenge, and if they are challenge oriented, they will stay with you, but if you hide it, then they're not really feeling that excitement and that challenge.

- 嗯,这是一个艰难的。我认为在早期有很多营业额,甚至在后期,风险融资之后,你正在学习如何聘请高管,但最终持续时间最长的员工是推荐,所以那里是一些共同的价值观,并在那里共享信任,我也真的把它们带入困难时期。有时你认为你是通过不告诉他们来保护人,但实际上,你是最亲密的员工,特别是当你四到六岁时,如果你带他们参加挑战,如果他们面向挑战,他们会留在你身边,但是如果你把它藏起来,那么他们就不会感到那种兴奋和挑战。

- At one point you said that you got an acquisition off, or one of your investors wanted you to just get acquired by a clothing startup,

- 有一次你说你收购了,或者你的一个投资者希望你被服装创业公司收购,

- A clothing startup.

- 服装创业公司。

- which, completely different.

- 哪个,完全不同。

- Yes.

- 是的

- I mean, you're having hard time, and here's, potentially, money in your bank account. What was your thought process in just turning that down?

- 我的意思是,你很难,而且这里可能还有你的银行账户里的钱。只是把它打倒了,你的思考过程是什么?

- Yeah. I've thought a lot about this. Right now, even in our space, there's a lot of consolidation, in the food space, in the meal-kit space. If you see the news, it's a very popular drama in the news. I mean, there's all these companies, like Facebook, or Snapchat, or this or that, that have turned down different offers over time, and sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong, judged by society. I just see so much potential in Gobble, and once we, early on, it was just that, early on I turned that clothing startup thing down, in that product-market fit time, because this is what I wanna work on, and I had nothing to lose. I didn't have kids, or whatever, and I just didn't imagine a better life than working on a hard problem, and now we've started doubling or tripling, year on year, and so if someone were to acquire us now, and we can't weather the storm of a bad meal-kit market, I think we're leaving billions on the table.

- 是的我对此有很多想法。现在,即使在我们的空间中,在食物空间中,在餐具空间中也有很多整合。如果你看到新闻,那就是新闻中非常受欢迎的剧集。我的意思是,所有这些公司,比如Facebook,或者Snapchat,或者这个或那个,随着时间的推移拒绝了不同的报价,有时它是正确的,有时它是错的,由社会来判断。我只是在Gobble看到了这么多的潜力,而且一旦我们,早期,就是这样,早在我把那件服装创业公司的东西放在了产品市场的合适时间里,因为这就是我想要的工作,而我没有什么可失去的。我没有孩子,或者其他什么,我只是没有想象一个更好的生活,而不是努力解决一个难题,现在我们开始加倍或三倍,年复一年,所以如果有人现在收购我们,我们无法度过一个糟糕的餐具市场的风暴,我想我们将在桌子上留下数十亿美元。

- Speaking of competition, there's been billions of dollars in venture funding going into competitors, or so-called competitors like Blue Apron, Plated, and so on and so forth. I mean, you were the original meal-kit company. What do you,

- 谈到竞争,有数十亿美元的风险投资流入竞争对手,或所谓的竞争对手,如Blue Apron,Plated等等。我的意思是,你是最初的餐饮公司。你是什​​么,

- yes. what do you think about? Like, all that money's going over there, but you're like, I'm here, surviving, and I'm growing fast. What's really going in your mind?

- 是的你有什么想法?就像,所有那些钱都在那里,但你就像,我在这里,幸存下来,我正在快速成长。你脑子里到底发生了什么?

- Yeah. Well, we can look at the silver lining of it, which is that necessity breeds invention, and so by not having that much money, we didn't get comfortable, and we had to innovate, and we had to have good numbers. So, I'm not saying that we should all starve our companies, but because we were somewhat cost-starved, I wasn't distracted by lots of fancy things, and I just focused on making all the dollars count, and doing something meaningful.

- 是的好吧,我们可以看看它的一线希望,这就是必需品种的发明,因此,由于没有那么多钱,我们感到不舒服,我们不得不进行创新,我们必须拥有良好的数字。所以,我并不是说我们都应该挨饿我们的公司,但是因为我们有点成本匮乏,我没有被许多花哨的东西分心,而我只是专注于赚取所有美元,并做一些有意义的事情。

- So, you talk a lot about mission, but beyond that, what actually, really, like how did you keep going, over the seven, eight years? Is it genetic? What do you think it really is, beyond just the mission?

- 所以,你谈了很多关于使命的事情,但除此之外,实际上,真的,就像你在七八年里一直坚持的那样?它是遗传的吗?除了任务之外,您认为它到底是什么?

- Wow, hmm. Man, maybe it is some kind of like nature-nurture thing. Mission is a big part of it, but with regards to the grit and determination thing, from an early age, I think I just... My parents wanted me to go to this school, this all-girls school, and I hated my current school. I was bullied a lot, and there was bad phrases and racist things on my locker, and bad stuff, and I applied to this girls school in kindergarten, and I didn't get in, and then in 1st grade, and I didn't get in, and in 2nd grade, and I didn't get in, and you had to take this ERB test, and then in those early grades they're asking you like, what's a triangle, or something, and I didn't get in, so I was like, what's going on? And my parents weren't donating, and there's all these other factors, but I didn't know that, and so I kept applying, and like 3rd grade, 4th grade, 5th grade, didn't get in, and I remember one time, my parents were like, the test is coming up. This is for your future. You need to do this, and I was just so mad. I just remember being so defeated, and so distraught, and like I was letting them down, and I didn't wanna take the test. I was like, who needs this school? Forget it! It's stupid! And I took the test, and I still didn't get in, and finally, in 7th grade I got into that school, and it changed my life. I used every resource they had. I started new organizations. I got funding from the principal of the school to start a model UN society, and I saw it in a different way, and I just seized the entire opportunity when I was there, because I knew how special it was, and I worked so hard to get there, and so, somehow, early on, that was one experience, but there were experiences like that, that I just learned that life is about hard work, and it's about lead bullets, and I'm always enamored by these real overnight successes. I think the most overnight successes are like 10 years in the making. There are some flukes that are like one year, or two year, or three years, that the media celebrates in a disproportionate amount, and I'm always very enamored by them, but the only way that I know is this lead bullets, grit, do-not-give-up strategy.

- 哇,嗯。男人,也许是某种像自然养育的东西。任务是其中很重要的一部分,但关于勇气和决心,从小就认为我只是......我父母希望我去这所学校,这所全女子学校,我恨我的现在的学校。我被欺负了很多,我的储物柜上有坏话和种族主义的东西,还有不好的东西,我在幼儿园的这所女子学校申请了,我没有进去,然后在一年级,我没有&#39;进入,在二年级,我没有进入,你必须参加这个ERB测试,然后在那些早期成绩,他们问你喜欢,什么是三角形,或者什么,我没有&#39;进去,所以我想,发生了什么?而且我的父母没有捐款,还有其他所有因素,但我不知道,所以我继续申请,就像三年级,四年级,五年级,没有进去,我记得一个时间,我的父母都喜欢,测试即将到来。这是为了你的未来。你需要做到这一点,我真是太疯狂了。我只记得被击败,如此心烦意乱,就像我让他们失望一样,我不想参加考试。我想,谁需要这所学校?算了吧!这很傻!我接受了考试,但仍然没有进入,最后,在7年级我进入那所学校,这改变了我的生活。我用过他们拥有的每一种资源。我创办了新的组织。我得到了学校校长的资助,开始建立一个模范的联合国社会,我以不同的方式看待它,当我在那里时,我抓住了整个机会,因为我知道它有多特别,我努力工作到了那里,所以,不知何故,在早期,这是一次经历,但有这样的经历,我刚刚得知生活是关于努力工作,而且是关于主要子弹,我总是迷恋这些真实一夜成名。我认为最近一夜的成功就像10年一样。有些吸吮就像一年,两年,或三年一样,媒体以不成比例的方式庆祝,而且我总是非常迷恋他们,但我所知道的唯一方法就是这种主要的子弹,砂砾,不要放弃战略。

- You were a very ambitious 3rd grader.

- 你是一个非常雄心勃勃的三年级学生。

- Thank you.

- 谢谢。

- Kindergartner, too.

- 幼儿园老师。

- Thank you.

- 谢谢。

- I wish we had known you back then. We would have just predicted all of this and funded you all the way back in kindergarten.

- 我希望我们当时认识你。我们本来就预测了所有这些,并在幼儿园一直资助你。

- That would have been great.

- 那会很棒。

- So, you talk about, obviously, never quitting, but do you think there are reasons to quit? -I guess I quit, kind of, on my first startup, and on one of the iterations of Gobble, and the only reasons I have ever quit is because I think what I was doing didn't have enough impact in the broader world, or fulfillment for me, and meaning and purpose for me. I thought about this question, and those are the only reasons I have quit in the past. I think, though, that said, I think if the environment evolves, and you can't keep up with it, and things are just way surpassing you, then that would be a really hard look in the mirror, and I would may need to quit in that instance. So, not getting comfortable, and constantly iterating, and being not dogmatic is important. A good example of that is Netflix. Netflix evolved to stay alive. There are a lot of big titans of industry that fell along the way because they couldn't evolve.

- 所以,你说,显然,永远不会放弃,但你认为有理由退出吗? - 我想我在第一次创业时,以及在Gobble的一次迭代中退出了,我退出的唯一原因是因为我认为我所做的事情在更广阔的世界中没有产生足够的影响,或为我实现,为我的意义和目的。我想到了这个问题,这些是我过去退出的唯一原因。我想,虽然如此说,我认为如果环境发展,你无法跟上它,而事情就超越了你,那么这将是一个很难看的镜子,我可能会需要在那个例子中退出。所以,不舒服,不断迭代,不教条是很重要的。一个很好的例子是Netflix。 Netflix演变为活着。由于无法发展,有很多行业巨头都在垮台。

- So, two more questions, and then we'll take questions from the audience. One is, when you look back, are there decisions that you made in the early days that you're thankful that you made, that were really critical to your success, and if so, what were they?

- 那么,还有两个问题,然后我们会向观众提问。一个是,当你回顾过去时,你是否有早期做出的决定,你感谢你所做的,这对你的成功至关重要,如果是的话,他们是什么?

- Well, I'll talk about two. So, one of them is... A lot changed when we hired our executive chef, Thomas Ricci, and it wasn't just... We hired a chef to make consistent food, and good food, and safe food in a kitchen. What we gained, though, was the ability to innovate in food, and what I have learned is, what I would suggest to an entrepreneur, is that real entrepreurship comes from diverse perspectives, and from innovating at the edge of different industries. It's really hard just to get 10 homogenous engineers in a room, and make something incredible. You have to have other experts in consumer, or food, or something, whatever else is in your industry, to really find those little insights. So, our success came from innovating in technology and personalization, but a lot from innovating in food, and doing that prep work, and sending these food packages in a way that no other company sends them. That's not trivial. So, making room for creativity in different areas of your business is important, and we didn't have that creativity when the suppliers were just contractor chefs. The second thing was, I have to thank Adora. She is way too humble. When I had no money, and I did YC, and I swallowed my pride, we were still doing that personalized dinner service, and somehow I got matched up with Adora, and we didn't even figure it out by demo day. We raised 200K on demo day. It was nothing, 'cause it wasn't the right timing. We hadn't figured it out, and that we had just hired our chef, maybe six weeks or four weeks before demo day. So, I started working with him, and innovating with him, and focusing on our future, and meeting with Adora at her office, and anyways, I came to her, and I told her about this meal-kit idea, this 15-minute prep kit, back in 2014, and she was just so scary to me, and really badass, and really aggressive, and she was like, "Ooshma," and she was like, "If this is it, "you need to fucking do it," and she was like, "You need to do it now," and I was like, Okay, and she was like, "How fast can you do it?" and you kinda wanna impress people, so I'm like, I don't know, like two weeks, and she was like, "Great," and she was like, and so, I mean, she basically was like, she was like, she was like, it was, we had four weeks, so she was just like, it was in July, and I remember because it was August 1st, and she's like, "Do it by August 1st," and I was like, Okay, great, and I don't even know if she remembers all of that, but that's what I thought of every single day for 30 days, and I shut down that personalized dinner service, and we were doing, maybe, like one and a half to two million in ARR, but it wasn't going anywhere, and the food wasn't different enough, and when we had tested and R and D'ed these prep kits, where people cook it themselves, and feel like a superhero, that was magical in our testing and our customer visits. So, within 30 days, we just ripped the Band-Aid off, shut down that business. It was the highest revenue-making iteration that we had ever built. With every iteration we made more revenue, ultimately, even though we shut it down, and then, on August 3rd, we launched this thing, and I emailed Adora this long email of, here are the screenshots, here's this, and I was using her to hold myself accountable, and I was like, it's launched, and that was the best decision of our lives, and so just speed to execute, and the other lesson is finding people who are in your corner. You need people who are in your corner, and it's okay to not talk to the ones who aren't, but finding people who are in your corner, who you can use as an inspiration to motivate you, is really critical for speed.

- 好吧,我会谈两个。所以,其中一个是......当我们聘请我们的行政总厨Thomas Ricci时,情况发生了很大变化,而且不仅仅是......我们聘请了一位厨师在厨房里制作一致的食物,美味的食物和安全的食物。然而,我们获得的是食物创新的能力,我所学到的是,我建议企业家,真实的企业家来自不同的观点,来自不同行业的创新。在一个房间里让10名同质工程师变得非常困难,并且做出令人难以置信的事情。您必须拥有消费者,食品或其他任何行业的其他专家才能真正找到这些小小的见解。因此,我们的成功来自于技术和个性化的创新,但很多来自于食品创新,做好准备工作,并以其他公司没有发送的方式发送这些食品包装。这不是微不足道的。因此,在您的业务的不同领域创造空间是很重要的,当供应商只是承包商厨师时,我们没有创造力。第二件事是,我要感谢阿多拉。她太谦虚了。当我没有钱,我做了YC,我吞下了自己的骄傲,我们仍然在做个性化的晚餐服务,不知怎的,我与Adora相匹配,我们甚至没有在演示日弄明白。我们在演示日筹集了200K。没什么,因为这不是正确的时机。我们没有想到这一点,而且我们刚刚雇用了我们的厨师,可能是在演示日前六周或四周。所以,我开始和他一起工作,和他一起创新,专注于我们的未来,并在她的办公室与Adora见面,无论如何,我来到她身边,我告诉她这个吃饭的想法,这15分钟准备工具包,早在2014年,她对我来说太可怕了,真的很糟糕,而且很有侵略性,她就像,“Ooshma”,她就像,“如果就是这样,”你需要他妈的做它,“她就像,”你现在需要这样做,“我就像,好吧,她就像,”你能多快做到这一点?“你有点想给人留下深刻印象,所以我喜欢,我不知道,就像两个星期,她就像,“很棒”,她就像,所以,我的意思是,她基本上就像,她就像,她就像,她就像,我们有四个几个星期,所以她就像是七月一样,我记得因为它是8月1日,她就像是“八月一号做”,我就像,好吧,太棒了,我甚至都不知道如果她记得所有这一切,但这就是我每天30天所想到的,然后我就关机了这个个性化的晚餐服务,我们正在做的,也许,就像ARR中的一个半到两百万,但它不会去任何地方,食物也不够差异,当我们测试了R和D&#39;时这些准备工具包,人们自己做饭,感觉像一个超级英雄,这在我们的测试和客户访问中是神奇的。因此,在30天内,我们刚刚关闭了创可贴,关闭了这项业务。这是我们曾经建立过的最高收入的迭代。随着每次迭代我们都获得了更多的收入,最终,即使我们关闭它,然后,在8月3日,我们推出了这个东西,我通过电子邮件向Adora发送了这封长的电子邮件,这里是屏幕截图,这是这个,我正在使用让我自己负起责任,我就像是,它已经启动了,这是我们生活中最好的决定,所以只是执行的速度,而另一个教训就是找到你角落里的人。你需要那些在你角落里的人,也可以不和那些不在的人交谈,但是找到你角落里的人,你可以用它作为激励你的灵感,对速度来说真的至关重要。

- Cool, yeah, one of the things I tell people, just do it already. Do it.

- 很酷,是的,我告诉别人的事情之一,就是这样做的。做吧

- Yes. Exactly.

- 是的究竟。

- You have the idea. Stop, just stop middling. Just do it. Okay, so last question from me is, 50 to 100 years from now, Gobble is gonna be even bigger it is today, but what do you think it's gonna be?

- 你有这个主意。停下来,停止中途停留。去做就对了。好吧,所以最后一个问题是,从现在起50到100年,Gobble今天会变得更大,但你认为它会是什么?

- Wow, I... You know, in the 50 to 100-year vision, I actually want Gobble to be, let's call it the Disney of the home, and my thing with Gobble is about creating magical experiences at home that are easy and fit into this busy life, for any kind of person, single parents, hourly working, affluent people. I think that with all this technology, and all this fast food, we've over-instrumented a lot of industries, and I was missing that connection, and I think at the end of the day, when our lives are over, all we care about are the moments with our loved ones, and so if I can facilitate some of that, whether it's with learning, whether it's with dinner or food, and I'll keep evolving with the environment, I think that's a worthy cause.

- 哇,我......你知道,在50到100年的愿景中,我实际上想要Gobble,我们称之为家中的迪士尼,而我和Gobble的关系是关于在家里创造容易的神奇体验适合这种忙碌的生活,适合任何一种人,单身父母,每小时工作,富裕的人。我认为,通过所有这些技术,以及所有这些快餐,我们已经过多地检测了很多行业,而且我错过了这种联系,而且我认为在一天结束时,当我们的生命结束时,我们所有人与我们所爱的人一起关心的时刻,所以如果我能够促进其中的一些,无论是学习,无论是晚餐还是美食,我都会随着环境不断变化,我认为这是值得的。

- It's interesting. So, it's gonna be more than just food.

- 这真有趣。所以,它不仅仅是食物。

- Yeah, we're working

- 是的,我们正在工作

- To my home.

- 到我家。

- on a few other things around education, and learning, and things like that.

- 关于教育,学习和类似事情的其他一些事情。

- Awesome, cool. All right, so who has questions?

- 很棒,很酷。好的,谁有问题呢?

- [Audience Member] This question is both you guys. You talk about grit and determination, right? But besides that, you mentioned problems like people who are living here, have customers here, but are on, let's say, working visa, H-1B, stuff like that, right? They eventually rounded that legal hurdle, like you see them making progress, and they've clearly made progress, but now they're like, I don't know, what do I do with grit? Because I'm running into that problem, right? So, what kind of suggestion do you have for those people that are in that situation, and now they're like, shit, I just can't do anything about it now. I don't know what to do.

-  [观众成员]这个问题是你们两个人。你谈论勇气和决心,对吧?但除此之外,你提到的问题就像居住在这里的人,在这里有顾客,但是在工作签证,工作签证,H-1B,这样的东西,对吗?他们最终绕过了那个法律障碍,就像你看到他们取得了进步一样,他们显然取得了进步,但现在他们就像是,我不知道,我怎么处理砂砾?因为我遇到了这个问题,对吧?那么,对那些处于那种情况的人,你有什么样的建议,现在他们就像是,狗屎,我现在对此无能为力。我不知道该怎么办。

- Repeat the question.

- 重复这个问题。

- Yeah, so I think the question is around that there are environmental constraints and legal constraints, with regards to immigration and H-1B, and things like that, that prevent people from being where they want to be with their customer, right?

- 是的,所以我认为问题在于环境限制和法律限制,关于移民和H-1B,以及类似的事情,阻止人们成为他们想要与客户在一起的地方,对吧?

- [Audience Member] They've already been there, and now what do they do now? Like they have to do it full-time. They've reached the stage.

-  [观众成员]他们已经去过那里,现在他们现在做了什么?就像他们必须全职做。他们已经到了舞台。

- If you have to do it full-time, but you have to live in another country, is that what you're asking?

- 如果你必须全职做,但你必须住在另一个国家,那你问的是什么?

- [Audience Member] You're already here. You have your customers here. There's no point in going back to where you came from.

-  [观众成员]你已经在这里了。你有客户在这里。回到你来自哪里是没有意义的。

- Oh yeah.

- 哦耶。

- [Audience Member] So, you are here. You made products on the side. The product is out, and you have your first customer, and now you've reached the point where you can't pull this thing off on the weekends or on the evenings. So, you have to do this full-time, but you can't. So, what do you do there? Grit and determination: what's the way out?

-  [观众]所以,你在这里。你把产品放在一边。产品已经淘汰,你有第一个顾客,现在你已经达到了在周末或晚上不能把这件事拉下来的地步。所以,你必须全职做这件事,但你做不到。那么,你在那做什么?勇气和决心:出路是什么?

- Hmm, well, I know one of my good friends had a similar problem, and these are very tactical things. They established some shell company, and then one of the investors was put on as a board member, and then that board member sponsored the sponsorship, but you're really the CEO of the company, and so there are, I think, first of all, getting that H-1B visa is insane, right? And we have people who can't get that visa, so Gobble actually has an engineering team in India and in South Africa, and we're just waiting for the visas, and some people have been waiting for 14 months, and they're still working for us remotely. So, in those situations, that's nuts, and now there's very few loopholes, but if you already are here, sometimes there's some things you can do. I think YC has helped with some of that stuff.

- 嗯,好吧,我知道我的一个好朋友有类似的问题,这些都是非常具有战术意义的事情。他们建立了一些空壳公司,然后其中一个投资者被当作董事会成员,然后该董事会成员赞助了赞助,但你真的是公司的首席执行官,所以我认为首先是所有,获得H-1B签证是疯了,对吗?而且我们有人无法获得签证,所以Gobble实际上在印度和南非有一个工程团队,我们只是在等待签证,有些人已经等了14个月,他们就是仍然为我们远程工作。所以,在那些情况下,这很疯狂,现在漏洞很少,但如果你已经在这里,有时候你可以做一些事情。我认为YC帮助了一些这样的东西。

- If you're making revenue, and you have an actual company going, there's ways to go about it. I would just talk with a lawyer.

- 如果你正在赚钱,而且你有一个真正的公司,那么就有办法解决这个问题。我只想和律师谈谈。

- Great.

- 太棒了

- [Audience Member] Hi, thank you so much for coming and sharing with us. Talk a little bit about the pricing journey of Gobble. I have a very successful offline business that I'm bringing online, and I'm scared, and I'm holding up because of pricing, so please inspire me and everyone else. Tell us about your pricing strategy for Gobble.

-  [观众成员]您好,非常感谢您的光临和与我们分享。谈谈Gobble的定价之旅。我有一个非常成功的线下业务,我正在网上,我很害怕,我因为定价而坚持,所以请激励我和其他所有人。告诉我们您的Gobble定价策略。

- Yeah, interesting. So, we've done a lot.

- 是的,有趣的所以,我们已经做了很多。

- Repeat the question.

- 重复这个问题。

- Oh yeah, sorry. Question is: tell us about the pricing strategy for Gobble, and how our pricing strategy evolved. Pricing is a big part of product-market fit, so it has to be priced appropriately for your market. Initially, we had different offerings at different prices on our marketplace. If you're in a scrappy company, the best tool for pricing experimentation is email, because it's hard to put different prices all over your website for different users. So, what I would do is email people, and I have a zillion things in beta all the time. So, I'd email our existing customers, and I'd say, hey, here's a beta on premium dinners, or here's a beta on value meals, or here's a beta on our wine program, and I would first do all the research of the market, and then send people, different clusters of people, three different prices, and in the early days I did it with like 20 people each, and then now I do it with like thousands of people each. So, in the early days it was a plain text email, and I would say, like, would you, and then sometimes to each individual person I would send three plans. I'd say, do you want plan A, B, or C? And so that, you can send different groups different sets of three plans, or you can send different groups different pricing for one product, but I would... You just, basically, you multiply the profit times how many people buy it, and whichever one wins in most profit is your best price.

- 哦,对不起问题是:告诉我们Gobble的定价策略,以及我们的定价策略如何演变。定价是产品市场契合的重要组成部分,因此必须根据您的市场进行适当的定价。最初,我们在市场上以不同的价格提供不同的产品。如果你是一个斗志旺盛的公司,定价实验的最佳工具是电子邮件,因为很难为不同的用户在你的网站上设置不同的价格。所以,我要做的就是给人们发电子邮件,而且我总是有很多测试版。所以,我会给现有客户发电子邮件,我会说,嘿,这是高级晚餐的测试版,或者这里是价值餐的测试版,或者这是我们葡萄酒计划的测试版,我会先做所有研究市场,然后发送人,不同的人群,三种不同的价格,并在早期我做了20个人每个,然后现在我做成每个成千上万的人。因此,在早期它是一个纯文本电子邮件,我会说,你会,然后有时对每个人,我会发送三个计划。我会说,你想要A,B还是C计划?所以,你可以向不同的团体发送不同的三套计划,或者你可以为一种产品发送不同的团体不同的价格,但我会......你只是,基本上,你将利润乘以有多少人购买它,以及无论哪一个赢得大多数利润都是您最优惠的价格。

- [Audience Member] Thank you.

-  [观众成员]谢谢。

- Right here.

- 就在这儿。

- [Audience Member] So, thank you for coming to talk to us today. YC is really pro having a cofounder, and you've done it on your own for a while, so can you talk about that?

-  [观众成员]所以,谢谢你今天来和我们谈谈。 YC真的是专业的联合创始人,你已经自己做了一段时间了,所以你能谈谈这个吗?

- The question is that YC is very pro having a cofounder, and that I did it on my own for a while, can I talk about that? Hmm, when I started Gobble, I looked for a cofounder, and I kinda just started it, like I found chefs on Craigslist, and I was delivering food in my car, but I was dating cofounders, that are now other YC founders, at the time, and no one at that time, in that three, four-month period was willing to quit their job and join me, or was randomly as passionate about my idea as I was, so it was a unique, this was all very organic. I didn't really think I must have a cofounder, or I must be a solo cofounder. I tried to find one, and my priority was leaping on this idea, and so I didn't find one, and I just went with it. Long term, I think it is hard, very hard, as a single founder. Right now, our exec team operates kind of like as a hive mind, and I share everything with them. So, after many, many years, now we have like a five-person super-team that's all very invested, and kind of like a cofounding team, but at scale. In the early days, what I say for single founders is, you kind of have, like if you're swimming in the ocean, it's kind of like a net/buoy system. So, you have to find like three or six people that are like those orange buoys, and you're swimming by yourself, and you're super-super-tired, and when you wanna rest, you swim over to one of the buoys, and you hug it, and you talk to them, and they help you, but then, since you don't have a cofounder, no one can be your rock, right? So, next time you need to rest, you swim over to another buoy, and you hug that, and you kinda like, you basically crowdsource your cofounder from other founders and friends, and you have to really find, and in fact, some of my closest friends were other single founders, and so I had a group of like two or three single founders, and we all would constantly meet up for coffee or drinks after work, and trade stories, and help each other.

- 问题是YC是非常专业的联合创始人,我自己做了一段时间,我可以谈谈这个吗?嗯,当我开始Gobble的时候,我找了一个联合创始人,我有点刚开始,就像我在Craigslist上找到了厨师一样,我正在我的车里送食物,但我和那些现在是其他YC创始人的共同创始人约会,时间,当时没有人,在那三个,四个月的时间里,他们愿意辞掉工作并加入我,或者随意地像我一样对我的想法充满热情,所以这是一个独特的,这一切都非常有机。我真的不认为我必须有一个联合创始人,或者我必须是一个独立的联合创始人。我试图找到一个,我的优先事项是跳过这个想法,所以我找不到一个,我就跟它一起去了。从长远来看,我认为作为一个单一的创始人,这很难,很难。现在,我们的执行团队有点像蜂巢一样,我和他们分享一切。所以,经过许多年,现在我们已经拥有了一个五人超级团队,这些团队都非常投入,有点像一个共同组建的团队,但规模很大。在早期,我对单个创始人说的是,你有点喜欢,就像你在海里游泳一样,它有点像网/浮标系统。所以,你必须找到像那些橙色浮标一样的三六个人,你自己游泳,你超级累了,当你想休息时,你游到一个浮标,你拥抱它,你和他们交谈,他们帮助你,但是,既然你没有联合创始人,没有人可以成为你的摇滚乐吧?所以,下次你需要休息时,你会游到另一个浮标,然后你拥抱它,你有点喜欢,你基本上将你的联合创始人从其他创始人和朋友那里挤出来,你必须真正找到,事实上,我最亲密的朋友是其他单身创始人,所以我有一群像两三个单身的创始人,我们都会在下班后不断见到咖啡或饮料,交易故事,互相帮助。

- Yes, right here.

- 是的,就在这里。

- [Audience Member] How has your life changed as we see you now, versus when you started? What were the lows? What were the highs?

-  [观众成员]我们现在看到你的生活与你开始时的生活有什么关系?什么是低点?什么是高点?

- Wow.

- 哇。

- Here, I'll--

- 在这里,我 -

- Please, I apologize.

- 拜托,我道歉。

- So, the question is, how has your role as CEO changed from beginning to what it is now? Must have been dramatic.

- 所以,问题是,你作为首席执行官的角色从开始变为现在的状态如何?一定是戏剧性的。

- Yes. Okay, in the beginning, one of the highs is just that you're constantly innovating. That 24/7 maker time is very precious to me. By contrast, now my day is like full of meetings. It's like meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and then dinners, and so yesterday I get home at like 11:00 p.m., today we're staring at 8:00 a.m., and it's really full, and I have to fight for strategic time, and maker time, and we still need that to keep evolving, right? So, I cherish that part of the early days. Obviously, the lows are are when nobody cares about you. You barely have any customers. I'm just sleeping at our office, or laying on our couch, and I remembered in some of the lows, I just would put white paper all over, and I'd lay on the floor, and I'd just be like a blank slate, and I'd be like, okay, what's next? Come up with it. And so, those are the lows. The highs, now, are, it's really gratifying when people start to know you, and every time I meet a customer in the wild it makes my day, and when I get too far from the customer, I actually notice myself getting unhappy again. I think, if you care about the customer and that experience long-term, all the money will come.

- 是的好吧,在一开始,其中一个高点就是你不断创新。那个24/7的制造商时间对我来说非常宝贵。相比之下,现在我的日子充满了各种各样的会议。这就像会议,会议,会议,然后是晚餐,所以昨天晚上11点我回家了,今天我们盯着上午8点,它真的很饱,我必须为战略而战时间和制造商时间,我们仍然需要不断发展,对吧?所以,我很珍惜早期的那一部分。显然,低潮是在没人关心你的时候。你几乎没有任何顾客。我只是在我们的办公室睡觉,或躺在我们的沙发上,我记得在一些低谷,我只是把白纸放在一边,我躺在地板上,我就像一个空白的石板,我想,好吧,下一步是什么?想出来吧。所以,那些是低谷。现在,当人们开始认识你时,真的很高兴,每当我在野外遇到顾客时,它就会成为我的一天,当我离客户太远时,我实际上会发现自己再次感到不快。我想,如果你关心顾客和长期体验,所有的钱都会来。

- Okay, let's take two more questions. One in the back.

- 好的,我们再问两个问题。一个在后面。

- [Audience Member] Yeah hi, my name is Shiraz, I'm the cofounder of Indiria, and one of my question is that in early stages you have to work with a lot of people, and how do you work with those people so that you have your sales, where you're getting the money from, but you also have people that work with you, and help your company grow? So, my question is, how do you get that happening without pestering them, like, hey,, hey,, but how do you do that in a good manner, and make them believe in your vision and work?

-  [观众成员]嗨嗨,我的名字是Shiraz,我是Indiria的联合创始人,我的一个问题是,在早期阶段你必须与很多人一起工作,你如何与这些人一起工作您有销售,从哪里获得资金,但您也有与您合作的人,并帮助您的公司成长?所以,我的问题是,你如何在不纠缠他们的情况下实现这一目标,例如,嘿,嘿,但你如何以良好的方式做到这一点,让他们相信你的愿景和工作?

- Yeah, that's great question. The question is, in the early days, you have I think the question is this: that you have your team that you're working with, and your customers, but there are other people that aren't on your team, that help you, and they're like mentors, advisors, friends. How do you get those people to work with you, without feeling like a pest, or that you're pestering them? I had a lot of this, so this is a really good question. Two things. One, I targeted the right advisors to help me, and I would find out where they were speaking, and I would wait till everybody was done talking to them, and be the last one to talk to the speaker, because they would remember me, and then I would walk them to their car, because they were in a rush. So, again, this is about psychology, and what does a speaker need to do? They've talked to 100 people. They need to go. If you carry their bags to their car, you're helping them, in a small, little way, and you're showing kind of some respect there. That's how I found Aaron Patzer from Mint.com back in the day, who was one of my early advisors, and some other people. That was a hack to finding the right mentors, find out where they are, and wait, and then follow up. The other thing is, I only asked people questions that was in their wheelhouse. So, I learned a lot about, what should I ask this person? Because when you spend time with someone who's like a mentor, and let's say you ask me about enterprise sales. I don't know anything about I know a little bit, but I don't know a lot about enterprise sales, and so it's kind of, it makes them feel bad, and it's also a waste of your time, and what I would do with people is I would bring I structured like a white piece of paper in three kind of thirds, I guess, and the top would be my progress, like what have I done since I last saw you? The next third would be, what am I working on now? And the last third would be, what are my challenges? And I was very organized about, all the time, that I asked from people, and so they always saw progress, and then they would see their advice come back, and I would save all my notes. So, in the early days, I met Reid Hoffman, and there was this cafe called University Cafe, and I went to cafes that only had paper tablecloths, and we would write all over the tablecloth, and then I would like take, it had coffee stains on it and stuff, and I would take it home, and I still have this box of those tablecloths that are like big butcher papers from like five, six years ago. So, it's just like, I think about all those little things, and about making time useful, taking notes, being prepared, and meeting with the right people.

- 是的,那是个很好的问题。问题是,在早期,你认为问题是这样的:你有你的团队,你和你的客户,但还有其他人不在你的团队,帮助你,他们就像导师,顾问,朋友。你如何让这些人与你一起工作,而不是感觉像一种害虫,或者你是在纠缠他们?我有很多这个,所以这是一个非常好的问题。两件事情。一,我瞄准了正确的顾问来帮助我,我会发现他们在哪里说话,我会等到每个人都和他们说话,并且是最后一个与发言者交谈的人,因为他们会记得我,然后我会把它们带到他们的车上,因为他们很匆忙。那么,这又是关于心理学的,说话者需要做什么?他们与100人交谈过。他们需要去。如果你把他们的行李带到他们的车上,你会以一种小小的方式帮助他们,而你在那里表现出一些尊重。这就是我在当天找到Mint.com的Aaron Patzer,他是我的早期顾问之一,以及其他一些人。这是一个黑客,找到合适的导师,找出他们在哪里,等待,然后跟进。另一件事是,我只问了他们驾驶室内的问题。所以,我学到了很多东西,我应该问这个人什么?因为当你和一个像导师一样的人花时间时,让我们问你关于企业销售的问题。我不知道有什么关于我知道的事情,但我对企业的销售情况知之甚少,所以它有点让人觉得不好,这也浪费你的时间,我会怎么做与人相处的是我会把我的结构像一张白纸三种三分之一,我猜,顶部将是我的进步,就像我上次见到你以后所做的一样?接下来的三分之一,我现在在做什么?最后三分之一,我的挑战是什么?我一直非常有条理地向人们询问,所以他们总是看到进步,然后他们会看到他们的建议回来,我会保存所有笔记。所以,在早期,我遇到了里德霍夫曼,有一家名为大学咖啡馆的咖啡馆,我去了只有纸质桌布的咖啡馆,我们会在桌布上写字,然后我想拿,它有它上面有咖啡渍和东西,我会把它带回家,而且我仍然有这样的桌布,就像五年,六年前那样的大屠夫纸。所以,就像,我想到所有这些小事情,以及让时间变得有用,做笔记,做好准备,以及与合适的人见面。

- I think, also, and you mentioned this, but I just wanna pull it out is being very thoughtful with the questions you ask, and being very specific, instead of asking broad questions that could take hours to answer.

- 我想,也是,你提到了这一点,但我只是想把它拉出来,对你提出的问题非常周到,并且非常具体,而不是提出可能需要数小时才能回答的广泛问题。

- Yes.

- 是的

- You're more likely to get an answer as a result. Okay, last question. Make it good. Guy in the back.

- 你更有可能得到一个答案。好的,最后一个问题。做得好。在后面的家伙。

- [Audience Member] Hi, my name is Mark Rafael. In fact, I was so eager to hear you today, I left my exhibitionto come here.

-  [观众成员]嗨,我的名字是Mark Rafael。事实上,我今天非常渴望听到你,我离开了我的展览来到这里。

- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

- 哦,天哪,非常感谢你。

- [Audience Member] Question is about investors. Actually, you said that you struggled a lot to get investment at the very beginning. You gave us some hacks, how you get customers. You simply don't get mentors What do you do? Did you develop some strategy over time to get good investors?

-  [观众成员]问题是关于投资者的。实际上,你说你一开始就很努力地获得投资。你给了我们一些黑客,你如何获得客户。你只是没有得到导师你做什么?您是否随着时间的推移制定了一些策略以获得优秀的投

- Wow, great question. The question is, we talked about hacks with getting customers, and what are the hacks around getting investors, 'cause I struggled with getting investors in the early days. I think, as you observe all your friends, everybody has lucky kind of easier fund-raising rounds, and everyone has hard fund-raising rounds. So, even if someone has it easy right now, and you have it hard, it's okay. It might be hard for them later, and the stories are very up and down. How do you get investors? Wow, it's still tough. For example, even last year, for our series B, I had a very difficult time raising money. It all looks fantastic, and there's lots of news, and videos, but it took every ounce of my being. It was the hardest fund-raising, and it's because Amazon acquired Whole Foods, and everyone is afraid of Amazon, so they just thought Amazon's gonna do Gobble, and also because Blue Apron went public, and they don't have a lot of defensibility, and there's lots of companies that are repackaging groceries, so their stock price went down, and that meant that Gobble wasn't going to work. So, last year was really, really hard. What advice do I have? I think that... Oh, here's one good piece of advice: a lot of it is grit, and a lot of it is testing, and then watching what resonates with people, and perfecting your pitch, and it's weird to practice in front of friends, but you should really, really do it, and have everyone help you with your deck and your pitch. That's important, but the one advice I have, and this may not be true for everyone, but some founders that are shyer, or not as confident, when they get to their last slide, they say, even if, and they say, even if the world ends, I will still get you your money back, and investors do not care about getting their money back. That is not sexy to them. You shouldn't say that. Founders are kind of like hedging against themselves, and saying, don't worry, I'll still protect your money, but you need to up-level that when you go talk to investors, and not say, even, if you need to say, you need to say that, we have the potential to be the next big X. We have the potential to be a $10 billion business in three years, and pump yourself up, stretch, power pose, but you have to end on that really big high note, very strong, and that's my piece of advice.

- 哇,好问题。问题是,我们谈到了获取客户的黑客行为,以及围绕投资者的黑客行为,因为我在早期努力吸引投资者。我想,当你观察所有的朋友时,每个人都有幸运的筹款轮次,每个人都有很多筹款轮次。所以,即使有人现在很容易,你也很难,但没关系。以后对他们来说可能很难,故事也是如此。你如何获得投资者?哇,它仍然很难。例如,即使是去年,对于我们的B系列,我也很难筹集资金。这一切看起来都很棒,而且有很多新闻和视频,但它花了我每一盎司。这是最难筹集的资金,这是因为亚马逊收购了Whole Foods,而且每个人都害怕亚马逊,所以他们只是认为亚马逊会做Gobble,也因为Blue Apron上市,他们没有很多防御性而且有很多公司正在重新包装杂货,因此他们的股价下跌,这意味着Gobble无法运作。所以,去年真的很难。我有什么建议?我认为......哦,这是一个很好的建议:很多是砂砾,很多是测试,然后观察与人产生共鸣的东西,并完善你的音调,在前面练习很奇怪朋友,但你应该真的,真的这样做,并让每个人帮助你的甲板和你的球场。这很重要,但我提出的一条建议,对于每个人来说这可能都不是真的,但是当他们到达最后一张幻灯片时,有些创始人会不喜欢或者不自信,他们说,即使他们说,甚至如果世界结束,我仍然会把你的钱还给你,而投资者并不关心收回他们的钱。这对他们来说并不性感。你不应该这么说。创始人有点像对冲自己,说,不要担心,我仍然会保护你的钱,但是当你和投资者谈话时你需要提升水平,而不是说,即使你需要比如说,你需要说的是,我们有可能成为下一个大X.我们有可能在三年内成为一个价值100亿美元的企业,并且自我提升,伸展,力量摆出姿势,但你必须以此结束非常高调,非常强大,这是我的建议。
