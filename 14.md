Ammon Bartram and Harj Taggar - Building an Engineering Team

Geoff Ralston: ...
As the slides are loading.
There is no topic that should occupy your minds  more, as you build your company, than bringing on the team that's going to make  your company successful, as you move forward. Harj and Ammon from Triplebyte, YC alumnus, are  gonna talk about building in today's day and age, perhaps the key portion of that  team, the engineering team. So, please welcome ... Harj, you're starting, yeah? Harj.
Harj Taggar: Alright, thanks for having us everyone! I'm Harj, I'm one of the co-founders of Triplebyte  along with Ammon. Previously, I used to be a partner at Y-Combinator.
And part of  the inspiration of starting Triplebyte was noticing how after graduating Y-Combinator and raising the first  investment round, everyone's number one problem was hiring and specifically hiring engineers 'cause it's sort  of the hardest hiring challenge. So, through working on Triplebyte, which is a hiring marketplace  that's used by engineers to find new places to work, Ammon and I have gathered  lots of data on what works well when it comes to hiring engineers.
I've personally  focused a lot on spending time with companies, helping them think through their strategies for  finding engineers and obviously getting the most out of Triplebyte.
And Ammon spent a lot  of time thinking through the details of how do you evaluate an engineer? How do  you evaluate their engineering skill, and answer the question of "are they a good engineer  or not?" So we're going to share that and have a divide and conquer strategy  going on here.
The four main topics we're gonna cover are where to look for  engineers, when you should start thinking about using recruiters, and that's what I'm going to  start with.
Then we'll talk about evaluating technical skills, which Ammon's gonna cover.
And then  I'll finish up by talking through the process of making offers and closing, which is  getting people to actually join your team. But before we start on any of that,  I want to just issue a warning and make sure you're well prepared for the  fact that hiring really well and truly sucks.
It's an incredibly painful process for many  reasons, which I'll describe in detail.
The first is it takes a lot of time.  It takes a lot of time just to convince someone good to even have a  conversation with you.
And as a founder, as you know, time is a very scarce  resource.
There's bugs to fix, there's sales, customers to close, various things going on.
And  hiring will never feel like it's your top most urgent priority, and it's very easy  to procrastinate and push it back. But if you do that for too long, you  won't scale, and you won't grow your startup. Someone else will come along, do that,  and take the market.
Two, hiring involves a lot of repetitive work. So actually as  Tyler was giving his presentation, I was talking to Jeff about this back there, there's  a lot of similarities between sales and hiring.
Actually there's a lot of similarities between  sales and hiring and fundraising and lots of things that you do as a startup  founder.
A large part of it is effectively selling all the time.
And selling, as  Tyler pointed out, involves a lot of repetitive work. So hiring will involve lots of  messaging, it'll involve taking lots of coffee meetings, lots of phone calls, lots of interviews,  and most of those will result in a dead end and be a complete waste  of your time. But you have to keep going.
And finally, you will get your  heart broken. You will inevitably end up getting rejected by people who you really wanted  to hire, who would have been the perfect fit to help you hit your growth  goals, but it turns out they were never really that serious about leaving their comfortable  job at a big company to join your exciting, but risky, startup. So be prepared  for all of this and as you're thinking through building your hiring process, I encourage  you to think about this as a funnel that you're creating that has three parts  to it.
The top of the funnel is sourcing, and that's finding people who could  be good fits.
The second is screening, that's answering the question of "do you want  to hire this person or not?" And the final part of the funnel is closing,  making the offer and getting the offer accepted.
I'm gonna start by talking through some  strategies for building the top of your hiring funnel.
These are the five places I'd  recommend that you look for making engineering hiring, for making engineer hires.
I'll talk through  the pros and cons of each of these.
They are personal networks, hiring marketplaces, LinkedIn  / GitHub, Job Boards, and Meetups.
I'll talk about how you can get the most  out of each of these.
And this list is ranked, or it's sorted in order  of where I think you should start out focusing most of your attention and energy,  down to where you should focus the least. So, we start with personal networks.
In  my opinion, personal networks are the best place to hire especially when you're early and  making your first few hires by far.
And the reason is, anytime you're deciding if  you wanna hire someone, you're essentially asking yourself two questions. One, does this person have  the skills that you need for them to do the job? And two, can you  personally work effectively with this person? When you're a big company, you can mostly focus  on answering just the first question because you're large enough, there's enough people, there's enough  teams that it's likely that one team somewhere will be able to work effectively with  anyone. But when you're small, that's not true. Whether you can work effectively with someone  or not is a big determiner of your success.
And if you hire the wrong  person early on, that can literally be fatal. So when you hire someone that you've  worked with previously, or you hire someone that's worked with a person you trust, you  de-risk the chances that you won't be able to work well together, which is a  big thing to consider early on. So that probably sounds like somewhat obvious advice.
And  yet, I'm surprised by how often founders still don't really use their personal networks effectively  when they're hiring.
And I think there's two reasons for this.
The first is they  don't use a process to exhaustively search through everyone they could potentially hire.
And the  second is they don't actually make the ask.
That usually comes down to being afraid  of being rejected by your friends.
It's somewhat easier, actually, to be rejected by a  complete stranger than to ask your best friend to come join you and they say  "uh, I'm not sure the idea's that great." There's also, you can also worry about  what happens to the friendship if the startup doesn't work out? There's sort of more  that goes into it when you're talking to someone that you know personally than when  you're talking to someone you don't. But the truth is, you just have to suck  it up and do it.
If you want your startup to be successful, hiring from  people you know is a tremendously valuable resource, and you just have to make that  ask.
I'd recommend you follow a strict process here. Start with just making a list  of every good engineer you know, whether you think they're available or not.
That's actually  completely irrelevant. Doesn't matter if they just sold their company for a billion dollars, put  them on the list.
Then, ping each and every one person on that list to  meet up and commit to asking them if they would join you. However crazy you  think it is, however unlikely, commit to making the ask.
If they say no, or  they're hesitant, sort of de-risk it a little bit and say, "Will you at least  come by the office and see what we're working on?" If the office is your  apartment, that's totally fine too. But just keep pushing until you've at least shown them  something that you've done. Keep working on convincing them.
If it doesn't work out, if  they say no, and you get a definitive no, then ask them if they were  in your position, who would they try and hire. Make a list, and go out  and repeat this exact same process with them.
This process just never ends. Like I  know public company startup founders, well no longer startups, but public company founders who still  do this on a daily basis.
This is just like a key thing you have  to imbed in yourself as a startup founder.
As your company does scale and grow,  and you start putting a team together, you want to start tapping into the personal  networks of your team.
And the way I'd recommend doing this is team events, where  people brainstorm potential hires.
And this is commonly referred to as a sorting party.
The  way I'd recommend going about this is get everyone together, send out a shared spreadsheet,  and describe the role than you're hiring for. So if it's an engineering role, sort  of describe in detail who are you looking for, who are examples candidates, what are  skills and qualities you'd be excited about? And then literally have everyone spend 30-45 minutes  going through their LinkedIn or their Facebook or whatever right there and then, thinking of  everyone that could be a fit and putting them into the spreadsheet. Once that's done,  at Triplebyte I'll actually then personally follow up with anyone on that list who seems  like a good candidate or not.
And we've made several really great hires doing this.  It works really, really well.
And you can kinda make it a fun thing too,  right? So we'll do it at the end of the week, just before our Friday  all-hands.
There's food and drink and you can also offer referral bonuses to your team  to incentivize them to do this. Really make sure that you've used a [inaudible] ,  you're sticking to an exhaustive process, you're making the ask of the people you know,  and then as you scale, tap into the personal networks of your team. Once you're  sure that you've exhausted your personal network for leads, the next place I'd start looking  would be hiring marketplaces. Hiring marketplaces are actually relatively new.
They've become more popular over  the last few years as it has become harder to hire engineers by using traditional  methods like reaching out on LinkedIn or GitHub.
And I'm gonna talk more about that  next.
The way I think about hiring marketplaces, is they actually work a lot like  dating sites.
The idea is there's engineers who create profiles, companies that create profiles, and  both are advertising their best selves. You message each other and you figure out if  it's worth meeting up in person and if it all works out you make a  hire.
The dynamics of the marketplace is, though, such that the demand for good engineering  talent far exceeds the supply. So, typically, it's the companies that are being a lot  more proactive in terms of reaching out first to the candidates.
The candidates are getting  multiple sort of inquiries and the candidates, or the engineers, are the ones that are  choosing who they want to speak to and who they don't.
A big benefit of  using a marketplace, especially in the early stages, is that they can help you hire  very quickly because most candidates who are on the marketplaces are actively looking for a  place to move right now.
It's very quick to get on a phone call with  them and start pitching.
And if you run a good closing process, you can significantly  reduce the amount of time you'll spend as a founder on hiring. Which you sort  of see [inaudible] .
The downsides, though, are that they tend to be quite competitive.  So engineers are being reached out to by multiple companies at the same time. So  you'll have to be very effective at convincing them to join if you want to  make hires.
And the second is that they can be expensive. Most marketplaces will work  on a fee per hire basis, which can be 15-20% of the first year salary.  That's cheaper than a recruiting agency but still a significant cost if you're an early  stage startup.
I'm obviously biased here, because Triplebyte is a hiring marketplace, but I'd say  the 3 main ones that come up in conversation, at least when we're pitching customers,  would be Triplebyte, Hired, and [Vetree] . You should try ...
They're all free to  use to get started, so you're welcome to try it.
I'd say, Triplebyte, the way  we differentiate ourselves is essentially by having better candidates.
And we measure that by what  percentage of candidates that companies interview through Triplebyte do they make an offer to? And  that tends to be twice the rate that they make through other sources.
And just  as a general note, hiring is a funnel, you're automizing your funnel, so you should  pay attention to what percentage of candidates are making it through each step in your  funnel. When you're early, you won't have that many candidates, so you can't be that  scientific about it. But start capturing that data and building that in to the habits  you have when you're thinking about hiring.
The third source that I'd recommend you go  to and look at is LinkedIn and GitHub.
These are effectively the biggest online directory  of engineers in the world.
And most of hiring that's done at big companies is  through teams of technical recruiters reaching out to engineers on LinkedIn or GitHub, finding the  ones that fit certain keyword criteria, and sending them cold messages.
The reason they ...  and they go for a very high volume approach here. So a technical recruiter may  well send over 100 messages a day just in the hope that they get a  few replies.
And a dynamic that occurred, especially the last few years, is as there's  more technical recruiters, there's more messages going out on these platforms, so response rates are  dropping for everyone. Which means for early stage startups in particular, it's going to require  a lot of your time, sending a lot of messages, in order to get a  few interested candidates. So making this work for you requires, in my opinion, not playing  the high volume approach like a big company recruiting team would.
And instead spending the  time actually researching, reading the details of profiles through reading through someone's LinkedIn, looking through  their GitHubs, looking at the details of the work that they've done.
And sending a  smaller number of personalized, targeted messages and emphasizing when you send the message, why would  someone be a good fit for your company specifically, and give them clear evidence that  you've read their profile, and you're interested in them as an individual, as opposed to  sending a spam message. But that doesn't mean the message has to be super long.  I still advise keeping it short and concise. Just the key fact is there's proof  that you've read their profile. Final note here is send e-mails instead of messages.
If  you sign up for LinkedIn Recruiter Lite, which is about $120 a month, that will  give you access to Connectifer, it's a Chrome plug in that makes it really easy  to pull out e-mail addresses from anyone's LinkedIn profile.
And you'll consistently see much higher  response rates through e-mails than you will on messages. So definitely, definitely go for that.  The fourth place I'd start looking for engineers would be job postings or job boards.  The two main ones for startups are Stack Overflow jobs and AngelList.
I haven't included  Hacker News jobs on there because it's only available to YC companies, but Hacker News  jobs is somewhat unique in just it has a particularly high quality of engineer, and  I'd rank it second on this list, actually, if it were a stand-alone source of  engineers. Job boards in general do suffer from a quantity over quality problem. So, what's  good about them is you don't have to spend a huge amount of time posting  to one of them.
The downside, though, is that the time suck can come in  later, because most of the applicants you'll get will be vastly under qualified. You'll get  a lot of applications from people who aren't even really software engineers, and it'll take  a lot of your time reading through all of these resumes and applications to find  the one or two good applicants. So, to maximize your return, and maximize the number  of good applicants you do get, I'd recommend focusing on making your job listings unique  and interesting.
And bear in mind that the majority of job descriptions on the internet  are written by someone in a recruiting or marketing department, that's using corporate, boiler plate  language, that especially isn't going to appeal to an engineering audience, right? So, as a  startup founder, you can experiment to try and bring through a bit of your personality  in the job listing. So one thing you might try is write in the first  person, about the personal story for why you started the company, why you're excited about  the mission, and make it seem like ... Get that excitement and passion across. Other  things you could try is there anything unique about the culture? Is there anything specific  about the technical challenges or product challenges you're facing? So if you put in more  details, that again will stand out, 'cause big companies tend to be very generic and  vague when they're talking about what you actually get to work on there.
The final  source I'll talk about is actually physical, in person meetups. So, I don't think that  these are actually going to be very effective, and they're sort of a long shot.  The numbers just don't really work out.
In person meetups don't have that large of  a number of people in attendance, and the truth is most of the time, people  are there for free food and drink more than to actively find somewhere to work.  So it's unlikely that you're gonna find both a really qualified candidate who's actively looking  to move who's excited about your company.
And you also personally need to be very  effective at talking to strangers and convincing them of things, in order for this to  work at all. So, I've included it on there because I do know startup founders  who have had success through meetups, but they are few and far between.
If you  do try this approach, I'd recommend focusing on technical meetups. By that I mean, the  local Closure programming group where people get together and meet up and bring laptops and  work on things, is more likely a better source of engineers than going to Dreamforce.  The final thing you could try here is hosting meetups at your own office, right?  So, you could also combine this with the personal network hiring and use it as  an excuse to have friends come by the office or have their friends who are  engineers come by the office.
At Triplebyte, for example, one of our engineers is a  fanatical [eMax] user, and he hosts the Bay Area eMax meetup at our office.
And  it's sort of a ...
It hasn't worked for us for hiring, but it is  a good way to just meet and build a network of good engineers that could  come in valuable at some point in the future. So it's definitely worth considering. Now  I'm gonna talk about when you should think about using of recruiters.
Truth is, there's  not really any hard rule on when you should hire a technical recruiter.
I've seen  companies of less than 10 people hire one, I've seen companies wait until there are  50 people plus.
It's sort of ...
These are my opinions of when you should,  and I treat these as a rule of thumb. So first, I think that you  absolutely should wait until you've at least hired your first engineer before you consider bringing  on a recruiter in any capacity.
The reason for that is, I think general start  up advice applies here. So, one is just in general when you're hiring, it's good  for you to do the job yourself for a bit, so you feel the pain,  and you understand it.
And you understand the details of what makes someone good at  that role at your startup in particular, before you get out and hire someone. You'll  be better able to assess them so if you feel the pain of recruiting yourself,  I think you have a better shot at hiring the right recruiter for you.
And  the second reason I say is, it's like sales.
It's actually good for you to  go out and try and pitch and convince people to join your startup, so you  can just understand yourself what message works and what doesn't. Because as a startup founder,  you are always selling, and you never know when you might bump into someone who  could be a really great hire.
And if you've already sort of practiced the pitch  for convincing engineers to join you, you'll have that ready to go. So I'd recommend  making sure you always make your first hire before you try and delegate this to  a technical recruiter. Second, I'd expect to have a good hiring cadence. Somewhere around hiring  around an engineer a month for the next six months or so, before you start  bringing on a recruiter. Otherwise, it's likely they'll run out of work to do quite  quickly.
And then finally, as a rule of thumb, if you're spending more than 50%  of your time sourcing, that's all the things I mentioned before, and doing initial phone  calls and screens and getting people to come and meet you in person. Over 50%  is probably about the time when you want to start thinking about bringing on help.  Because 50% is about the amount of time you want to be spending on hiring.  So recruiters themselves come in roughly three types. You have contract recruiters, who you pay  by the hour, and they can do anything from cold messaging on LinkedIn all the  way to doing initial phone screens.
There's in house recruiters, that's just hiring a full  time technical recruiter that works as a member of your team.
And the final would  be agency.
And agencies are essentially teams of sales people that are paying lots of  engineers on LinkedIn or wherever they can and then selling their resumes out to as  many companies as possible.
And they tend to charge 25-30% of first year salary if  you hire and engineer's resume that they sent you.
They do tend to be fairly  high touch, so they're quite involved in trying to give you information that will help  you close an engineer, but they're also sending that information to multiple companies at the  same time. My recommendations here would be, when you get to the point where you  feel its time to bring on help or bring on a recruiter, start with a  contract recruiter, and have them focus on just the sourcing piece of it. Have them  just focus on reaching out to engineers on LinkedIn and GitHub and their main deliverable  for you should be filling your calendar with calls with promising candidates.
Then you're doing  the pitching and convincing. When you get to a point where that becomes too much  work for just you, then I'd consider hiring a full time in house recruiter and  training them to do the pitch calls. So now they're both sourcing and doing the  initial calls and setting up the on site interview process for you. So, to sum  up. My startup hiring plan, if I were just getting going and building an engineering  team, would be start by making sure you've exhausted your personal network, spend lots of  time taking people out for lunch, coffee, making the ask.
Two, experiment with the hiring  marketplaces. Your mileage will vary on these depending on how effectively you can pitch your  company. But even if you don't make hires from them, you'll get valuable experience pitching  real engineers and real candidates and learning what resonates about your company to that audience.  Third, spend some amount of time doing personalized, targeted outreach to engineers on LinkedIn and  GitHub, making those messages really personalized.
And then finally, treat job boards and meet ups  and meeting people in person as a background process you run where you're not expecting  to make any hires from them, but you're building a general pipeline that could be  valuable in the future. Cool.
That's the first part of this.
Ammon's now gonna talk  about how to screen and evaluate technical school of engineers, then I'll jump back in  and wrap up with making offers and closing.
Ammon Bartram: Awesome! Thank-you Harj. So, I'm Ammon.
I'm Harj's co-founder at Triplebyte, and before this, I  started Socialcam with Michael Seibel and I was an early employee at Twitch.
I'm gonna  talk about just the screening step. So how to identify skilled engineers at your company.  The first question here is just why you should believe me about any of this.  One answer is that I've done a lot of interviews. Since starting Triplebyte, I've interviewed  over 1000 engineers personally. But I think a better answer is that Triplebyte has a  pretty special vantage point. We're able to see how candidates do in the interviews at  multiple different companies. We can see how the same candidate performs in multiple companies and  that gives us a data set that I think no one else has.
That data  is where the advice I'm gonna give today comes from. Before I jump in, I  wanna just go over the basic hiring process that most companies use.
This is actually  pretty standardized. So probably 95% of tech companies use these basic steps to screen candidates.  First is a resume screen. Someone applies to a company, they send in a resume,  and a recruiter looks over the resume and decides if this looks like someone who's  a basically good fit.
Then a recruiter call.
This is usually a 30 minute phone  call with the recruiter, just ask about the candidate background, judge culture fit, and make  sure they're interested in the company.
Then a technical phone screen.
This would be between  30 minutes and an hour with an engineer, usually solving a single programming problem. So  this is sometimes something like Fizz Buzz or a little bit harder. Often at this  point done over a synchronized text pad of some sort.
Then, this is optional, sometimes  a take home project. So a substantial project which the candidate completes on their own  time and then sends in to the company to be evaluated.
Then finally the on  site interview. So the candidate comes into the office and does between 3 and 6  one hour sessions with engineers at the company, covering individual problems.
And then finally a  decision meeting. So usually the next day after the candidate has gone home, everyone who  interviewed the candidate and the hiring manager gets together in a room and talks about  their perceptions and they as a group make a hire / no hire decision. Some  stats on this. Companies make offers to between 2 and 8% of all of the  engineers who apply. But interestingly, exactly where in the process that drop off happens is  very different between companies. So we see companies where 75% of people who apply get  screened out at the first step on a culture fit call.
Then we see companies  where almost all applicants make it through to the final interview and that's where all  the screening happens.
And about 95% of people who are hired work out.
That is,  about 5% of technical hires result in someone being fired within a few months. From  the candidate side, what we see is a distribution of success in interviews. So the  top few percentage points of programmers by skill receive job offers after most of their  interviews. But then the bulk of programmers are somewhere in the middle where they do  interviews and they receive offers after somewhere between 15-30% of the interviews they do.
An  interesting point is that no one passes all their interviews.
There are not magical engineers  who receive offers after every interview they do.
This gets at what I think is  the major challenge when designing an interview process, and this is inconsistency.
This is noise  in the interview process.
It's kinda the idea ...
Is your interview fundamentally repeatable and  meaningful? If you could somehow re interview your coworkers, your employees, everyone who had passed  your interview in the last year ...
If you could re interview those people, how  many of them would pass again? It's a pretty scary question, but an interesting thing  is we've been able to get some data on this. So what I did was  I calculated a stat called “the inter-rater reliability” between all of the interviewers at all  of the companies on Triplebyte. So what that means is this is the statistical measure  of the extent to which different interviewers tend to agree about which candidates are best.  It's on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 would be no agreement or  the amount of agreement you would expect to see in random data from chance alone,  and 1 would be perfect agreement.
And what I found was an agreement of just  over 0.1. First point is that's obviously much closer to no agreement than it is  to perfect agreement. But for some context on that, I calculated the same stat on  a data set of online movie reviews.
And what I got was an agreement of  very similar but it's actually slightly higher. So it ends up that interviewers agree about  which engineers are the best at about the same rate that Netflix viewers agree about  which movies are best. Yeah, that's scary.
Interviews are fundamentally noisy and the data shows  them to be more noisy than most hiring managers want to believe. So the first  question here is, why do interviews at all, then? If interviews are so noisy, why  do them at all? Why can't we just use something like trial periods to screen  engineers? Yeah, I think this is actually a great idea.
It is almost certainly much  more ...
If you can work with someone for a week, you can almost certainly  get a much better sense of if they're a good employee than you could in  a three hour interview with them.
The problem is that most engineers don't actually want  to do trial periods. We did some research at Triplebyte and it ends up that  only 20% of engineers are willing to do trial periods.
And there's actually some adverse  selection there. So, most of the best programmers are in the 80% who would prefer  to do a standard technical interview, because it takes less of their time and is  faster. So I think that trial employment is an excellent option, and you can offer  that as an option, but if you don't want to scare away most good programmers,  you do have to still run a standard traditional interview process. What I'm gonna talk  about today is specific pieces of advice that you can use to try to reduce  the noise in a traditional interview.
And I'm gonna go over seven points. Point one,  the first way to reduce noise in an interview, is to decide what skills matter  for your company.
There are a lot of different ways that a programmer can be  skilled. So someone, for example, can be very productive, or they can be slow, careful,  right great tests, and make sure they don't commit bugs. Someone can be strong in  math and computer science or they could be deeply knowledgeable about the internals of the  Linux kernel and scheduling in real-time operating systems or something.
If you don't decide as  a founder which of those skills matter for your company, then your interviewers are going  to decide that for you. So they are going to come up with questions that  they ask in the interview process, and they will fail people who answer poorly on  those questions, whether or not those are areas that should matter for your company.
This  is actually a major source of noise in interviews. Every engineer has this bias where  they think the things they know the best are the most important skills one could  know.
And absent specific direction from above about what to look for, they will fail  people for areas that are not important for your company. So my first piece of  advice here is that you should go through and ask yourself these questions before you  start hiring.
The first is ...
To clarify, these are the axes along which we  see most disagreement between interviewers.
The first question is, do you need fast iterative programmers  or someone who is careful and rigorous? Do you want to hire someone who's motivated  by solving hard tech problems or someone who is motivated by building beautiful product for  users? Is it important that someone comes in with skill in a particular technology, a  particular language say? Or do you want to hire a smart person and let them  learn your tech stack on the job? Is academic computer science, or algorithm ability, something  which is important to you or is that an irrelevant skill? And then, is there  any other specific expertise that you need in people you're hiring? It's actually fine to  answer both to some of these questions. You don't have to specify only a single  profile of person you're hiring.
The important thing is to decide what matters, even if  that's multiple profiles.
That sets you up to design the rest of your process and  make sure that you're not failing people for being bad in irrelevant areas. Point number  two. Second way you can reduce noise in interviews is to use structured interviews. So  to define this, a freeform unstructured interview is an interview where an interviewer gets in  a room with a candidate and they ask questions and they follow their intuition. Based  on the answer the candidate gives, they ask follow ups and they try to get  a sense of what the candidate feels like, if that person can be a good  fit for the company.
And at the end they make a global yes/no, hire/no hire  decision based on that interview.
And that contrasts with a structured interview where the interviewer  comes into the room with a question which they're gonna ask and a defined criteria  they're trying to evaluate.
The very interesting point here is that everyone thinks that free  form interviewers feel better.
Almost all interviewers prefer free form interviews and they think they  are more accurate.
And many candidates, if you ask them, actually say that they prefer  to be interviewed in that way. But the interesting thing is that this is completely  opposite to all the available data on this. Structured interviews are simply more predictive.
They  are better at predicting success on the job and there's no excuse not to use  them. We should all be using structured interviews.
I'm gonna go over some examples of  what that means.
The first thing is that you have to hold the process constant.  So the goal of an interview is essentially to evaluate variance in candidates and if  you do not hold the rest of your process constant between candidates, you are introducing  noise. So there is simply no excuse for not asking every candidate for the same  job the exact same set of questions.
I think the reason this is not more  common is that the interviewers themselves tend to find this boring and all I can  say is suck it up. You have to do that. So second point on structured  interview is that you want to give your interviewers defined criteria to evaluate. So rather  than putting them in a room and saying, “Decide if this person would be a  good fit for the company?” Say, “We care about coding productivity and knowledge of back  end web systems.
And so your goal is to ask this question in the interview  and grade the candidate on coding productivity and knowledge of back end web.” There's actually  some great research on this.
It ends up that a lot of the worst biases  that can come up in interviews are made worse when the interviewer is trying to  make a global decision. So if someone is making a global, “does this person feel  like a good employee?” decision, that's where things like “do they look like someone that  I knew in the past?” or their race, their gender, that's when those things come  into play.
Interviewers are much better at ignoring those attributes when they're given a defined  criteria to evaluate.
The final point is that you wanna unify decision making.
This applies  mostly to larger companies, but you wanna make sure that one person or one group  of people is involved with all the final decisions. So rather than viewing interviewers as  people making decisions, view them as people taking notes, grading candidates on criteria, and then  all those notes and criteria go to a centralized person or a centralized group who  makes the final decision.
And the idea is just that, again the goal is consistency,  and it's far more easy to be consistent if one person is making all the  decisions. Point three for how to reduce noise is just to use better interview questions.  And so I have some tips on that.
The first is that you want to  avoid questions that require a leap of insight from the candidate.
And rather you want  questions where there is a gradual ramp of steps that they can follow that lead  to a solution.
As the general idea, the rule of thumb I like, is that  you can ask yourself, can this question be given away? So if it's a question  that has a single fact in the solution which a candidate could know in advance,  and possibly be communicated to them by a friend, or by a thing they read  in Glassdoor, then that means that it's probably a bad question.
And an example of  that is there's the classic question.
The question is, “Imagine you're standing at the bottom  of a flight of stairs and every step you can take a single step up  one stair or a double step up two stairs. How many unique paths are there  to the top of the flight of stairs?” It ends up, the solution of that  is the Fibonacci sequence, kind of strangely.
If someone knows that, obviously that's the solution.  If they don't know it, they may well struggle and then think about it and  go down some rabbit hole. So that's the example of a bad question where this  leap of insight is the solution.
An example of a good question is “can you  please implement the game Connect Four for me?” There it's a series of steps, each  one relatively straightforward, but that leads to a solution and there's nothing someone's friend could  tell them in ten minutes which would give them a massively unfair advantage in the  game Connect Four. So another idea here, this is kind of related, but you want  multi-step problems.
Those tend to lead to problems that don't have leaps of insight, but  also candidates will often get stuck in the interview, even good candidates.
And if your  problem has multiple steps to it, you can give them a hint, you can help  them on one portion and still have enough left for them to go on to  do well and redeem themselves and demonstrate skill. Whereas if your problem is all in  one sort of nugget of difficulty, if they can't solve that and you have to  help them at that point they've basically failed, or done poorly on that section. You  wanna avoid specialized knowledge. So this is ...
If your goal is to assess general  programming ability, you probably want to ask questions that evolve things like lists and hash  tables and strings, rather than questions that evolve tries or prefix trees. Unless you've decided  that you really care about algorithm data structure knowledge and your goal is to make  sure that everyone knows about tries.
In that case, it's totally fine to ask about  them. But if you're measuring something else, if a try is a portion of the  problem, some portion of your candidates will be familiar with this, others won't, and that  will introduce noise. So in general, I think it's good to stick with the classic,  most basic CS concepts.
Another rule. You want to budget about three times the amount  of time it takes you to solve a problem for the candidate. So if you  come up with a question and you solve it yourself and it takes you ten  minutes, that's probably a good question for a 30 minute interview session.
And the reason  here is just that it's far easier to be the interviewer than it is to  be the candidate.
It's far easier to ask the question, and we tend to downplay  how hard the questions actually are. We did some actual research on this. We went  through all the questions we asked at Triplebyte and we looked which are most correlated  with candidates going on to succeed.
And it ends up that the most predictive questions  tend to be much easier than what our intuition going in was predicting. So it  ends up that most interviewers think that the optimal question is quite a bit harder  than the optimal question actually is. You want to make sure that you ask four  or more questions in an interview.
The idea here is that each individual question carries  a certain amount of noise. Has the person seen this question before? Is it ...  were they lucky answering it? If you ask more questions you'll get a more consistent  signal out.
And then, finally, just one tip.
A type of question we like a  lot at Triplebyte is a question where we give the candidate a problem and then  rather than wanting them to devise a solution, we tell them a solution to the  problem and then their goal is to take that idea and implement that in the  code.
And so we give them an algorithm and we see if they can implement  that algorithm rather than requiring them to devise an algorithm. Okay, the fourth way to  reduce noise is to ignore credentials during your interview. So by credential I mean things  like did someone study at a well-known school or has someone worked at a well-known  company? I'm not claiming that credentials are meaningless. Credentials are important, right? They're predictive in  any case.
The group of people who are ex-googlers are indeed better engineers than the  group of people who have not worked at Google. So it's totally legitimate to take  that fact into account when deciding whether to hire someone. However, it's not relevant to  their actual programming skill. So my advice here is to make sure that you're not  biased by the fact that someone comes from Google when you are narrowly evaluating their  programming skill. So I recommend that you hide that credential from the interviewers.
And the  reason is we've found that interviewers are actually significantly biased by this.
If they know  someone has what we strong credentials, they are more likely to interpret the results of  the coding screen in a positive fashion. “Oh this person, you know, yeah they didn't  know that answer but I'm sure it was just a temporary slip up.” And so,  hide credentials from your interviewers, let them assess programming ability and then when making the  final decision, in the decision meeting, consider credentials and also the performance in the interview.  This will help you find the programmers who are skilled and who lack traditional credentials.  And those are the undervalued people on the market.
And as a startup, if you're  good at finding those people, that is a big advantage. Point five is that you  wanna think about the false negative rate in your interview. So a false negative is  when someone fails your interview who could have gone on to do the job well.  And the opposite, a false positive, is when someone passes your interview, you hire someone,  who then goes on to do poorly and probably be fired. Both false positives and  false negatives are very costly. So if you hire a bad person, you have to  fire them, that's terrible.
It harms the morale of the team, and it's also very  expensive in just actual money. Big problem. But, if you're a startup and you're really  hungering ... You're held back by not having enough engineers.
If you pass up a  person that could have joined your team, that could have been productive, that's also very  expensive.
I'm making a pretty subtle point here, but I think there's a bit of  a cognitive bias where false positives are very ... We're very aware of them.
If  we hire a bad person, we feel that pain for a month or a month  plus, best case. We've seen companies in trouble by it.
They generally have too much  faith that the folks who fail their process must have been engineers and couldn't have  done the job.
And that's empirically not the case.
If you watch ...
As I  said earlier, no engineer will pass all interviews. So a significant portion of people who  fail interviews do go on to be employed very productively at other companies. So I  just recommend that folks designing interview processes thinking about the false negative rate and try  to give that some weight in their calculations of setting hiring bars. One of my  goals for Triplebyte, actually, is to get to a point where you can actually measure  this rate. 'Cause no one knows what it is. No one knows what the false  rate on their interview is because to measure that you have to just hire people  randomly and see how they perform.
That's very expensive. My goal is to get to  a point where we can do that. Let's see. Okay, point six is that you  wanna generally calibrate on the maximum skill that each candidate brings rather than their average  skill or their minimum skill. So someone comes in an interview, they're very strong in  one area, they're weaker in others. What matters the most is what they were strongest  in. Everyone can look stupid, right? If you ask me the right question I will  definitely look very stupid, that's true for everyone out there.
The problem is that someone  might go through an interview and do very well on some things that might be  useful for the company but look stupid on one question.
And if that interviewer gives  a blocking note that that person was stupid, that's introducing noise in the process, perhaps.  Now again, if someone does poorly in an area that is important for the job,  totally fail them. But be open to the fact that everyone does look stupid sometimes,  and don't fail someone just because they look stupid on one portion of the interview.  Okay, final and last point here is that you want to think about the candidate  experience when designing the interview. You wanna make sure that every candidate who goes through  your process likes your company.
And this is true for a few reasons. One is  just that if they enjoy the process, they have a higher probability of accepting an  offer you make.
And so this will help in the closing step. But an interesting  point is that it will also actually make your screening itself more accurate, because stress  has a big impact on performance.
A high percentage of candidates get very stressed in  interviews and underperform their actual peak ability.
And so some tips here to help reduce  stress include just letting everyone bring in their laptop, work in their own environment, their  own language, their own tools, they'll be much more productive, much less stressed.
And then,  coaching your interviewers in some soft skills: being friendly, providing breaks for the candidates, and  when they are doing poorly on a section, training them in how to intercede in  a way which isn't too stressful and insulting to the candidate. Rule of thumb here  that comes from the old Joel on Software blog is that you want every candidate,  no matter how they do, to finish your interview, wanting to join your company. Even  people who fail your interview very poorly, you want them to end your interview wanting  to join and being excited about the opportunity.
And the final point, you want to  avoid hazing. So this is rare but results in some of the worst horror stories  of interviews.
This is where an interviewer takes on the role of a ritual of  acceptance into a group.
If this happens, it's terrible and as a hiring manager you  wanna stay totally away from that.
Those are my points.
I wanna emphasize that I'm  not saying you should lower the bar for who you hire.
I think if you  follow this advice, you will get a more accurate signal. You can then set your  bar for who you hire wherever you want on that signal, but you will still  be making, at that point, better hires. So just to summarize here, I recommend that  the first step you follow is to decide what skills matter for your organization. Make  sure that you're screening on things that you actually care about, and then design a  structured interview around those skills. So come up with ways to assess each skill and  structured criteria for the interviewers so that they are less likely to be biased by  outside factors.
Then you wanna use good interview questions: multiple parts, no leaps of insight.  You wanna hide credentials from the technical interviewers because that introduces noise into the process.  You wanna think about the false negative as well as the false positive costs in  your interviews.
And you wanna generally calibrate around the maximum skill that each candidate brings.  While doing all of that, you wanna try to provide a positive experience for the  candidate. So those are my tips. So far I think this all applies to both  big and small companies. So, I'm gonna go over a few points here that I  think are specific to, let's say, series A and smaller companies. One point here is  what if you're so small that you don't have the scale to standardize your process.  So you're a seed stage startup, you're hiring, you're interviewing your first few people, you  obviously can't run an extremely standardized process because this is the first few candidates to  have seen those questions.
That's a totally real point.
I think it still is worth  trying to run structured interviews. You won't have ... Your plan will probably be something  ... Like a google doc with some tips written down. But it still is helpful  to think about what skills matter and try to design questions that assess those skills,  that will still reduce the bad bias in the interview. Let's say that you're having  trouble sourcing. So you're an early stage startup and your number one problem is how  do you get enough qualified applicants for your company? So in that scenario, it's fairly  obvious that a false negative costs more. So if you're struggling to get people to  apply to your company, screening out someone who could have been good is very expensive,  more expensive than for a large company. But the flip side is that if you're  a small company, hiring a bad person is also way more costly, way more expensive.  So, it's not [inaudible] that the ratio of those two costs changes, so I think  you still have to care a lot about both.
I think what you can do  is be less aggressive about screening folks out early. So if you're an early stage  company struggling to source candidates, I recommend you are less aggressive in screening out prior  to your on-site. Pass more folks through and accept a lower final interview success rate,  in exchange for better screening all the applicants. Let's say that you're a small startup  and you just don't know what skills matter. So you're not sure if you wanna  hire someone who's very CS focused or someone who's very web focused.
There's no crisp  answer here so we have plenty of examples of billion dollar companies that have taken  various routes here. My personal advice, from Triplebyte and from social cam and from Twitch  when it was small, is that I believe strongly that the true most important skills  for the first few hires are productivity and ownership. So being able to basically take  a project, figure out what needs to be built, and just make that happen.
And  I recommend optimize for that at the expense potentially of code quality. So I think  the first few hires you should accept that perhaps they're writing crappy code but, by  God, they're writing it quickly and they're getting stuff done. Let's just say, that was  the case during the early stages of all three companies I've been involved with.
I  think that's normal and probably good. So let's say that you're hiring for an area  where you yourself don't have technical expertise. So you're a web developer and you need  to hire an IOS engineer. What do you do? So one answer is you can  use us, you can use Triplebyte, we'll help you do that. You can call in  friends to do the interview for you, if you have them. But I think a  good point here is that a trick that I've used in the past is to  just ask candidates to explain things. So you're a web developer, you ask the IOS  engineer a question, they give an answer, you have no idea if it's a good  answer or a bad answer. What you can do is just ask them to explain.  You say “Oh, that's interesting! Can you explain why that's a good idea?” And, for  the most part, if someone truly is a skilled IOS engineer they should be capable  of explaining their answer in terms that an experienced web engineer can understand.
That's not  always the case. Sometimes someone will come a long who's a good IOS engineer but  a bad communicator and that might fail them, but this is a pretty good trick  to hire outside your area of expertise. Okay.
That's basically it.
I wanna end actually  with an ask for you guys. So this is a ... We've been developing an  exercise for interviewers that we use when training new interviewers for Triplebyte and I wanna  see if I can get you guys to try this and e-mail me and let  me know how it goes because I'm curious if this works more broadly.
The idea  is that interviewers tend to significantly underestimate how noisy interviews are, they overestimate their own  ability to distinguish good engineers from bad engineers.
And part of becoming a better interviewer  is to become a little more humble and more aware of your own limitations. So  this exercise is designed to highlight that. What I want you to do is to  do a mock interview with one of your coworkers. So have one of your coworkers  interview you where they're role playing ...
They're asking questions and you're role playing a  candidate, you're giving answers.
And I want you to tell them in advance that you're  going to be giving bad answers to some of the questions, you're gonna be role  playing a candidate that makes mistakes.
And then during the interview, they ask questions, I  want you to half the time go ahead and give a bad answer, role play  a poor answer to the question, and the other half the time, give it your  best shot and give your best possible answer you know to that question.
And then  after the interview's done, do a debrief session where your coworker goes through and goes  over all the mistakes you made and gives you feedback. What's great here is that  they don't know what answers that you gave were intentionally bad and what were you  trying your best.
If they don't highlight a mistake you made, when you were trying  to make a mistake, they're gonna look a bit bad. So they're fully incentivized to  be completely honest and rigorous when pointing out the flaws they saw in the interview.  The criticism they give will apply both to the points where you were intentionally making  mistakes, but also to your attempts to give your best possible answers.
This ends up  being really interesting. We've been doing this a lot at Triplebyte and it is great  at highlighting how interviewers disagree. So if you do this with your coworker and you  do it a few times, reverse roles.
The result is that you'll highlight your areas  where you're both weak but you'll also highlight a bunch of areas where you have  legitimately strong disagreements about what constitutes the best answer to a technical question.
There will  almost certainly be more disagreement than you're expecting going in.
I found this super insightful.  I'd love if you guys could try this and e-mail me and let me know  how it goes.
Awesome.
That's everything for me. Harj is gonna talk about closing and  then we'll both answer questions.
Harj Taggar: Okay, I'm gonna wrap up here by going through best practices and points to optimize  your chances of people actually accepting the offers you make them.
I have five main  pieces of advice here.
The first is just understand as a startup in particular, speed  is a huge hiring advantage that you have over bigger companies.
Through Triplebyte we work  with startups and larger companies and we ourselves are surprised by how often a big  company can take weeks just to deliver the actual final offer details.
And when someone's  getting to the end of their job search process, that's where they're most keen to  just make a decision, move on, and know what they're doing. So as a startup  if you're quick at every step in your hiring process, from the moment you have  the first contact through to when you make the offer, you increase your chances of  closing a candidate. So just be fast and responsive at every step. Second, Ammon already  mentioned, train your interviewers to have a good bedside manner with interviewees. We ask candidates  or engineers on Triplebyte, what were some of the reasons you had bad experiences when  you went and interviewed in person at companies? And all of the replies centered around  their experience with their interviewers.
And the top two complaints were interviewers not being familiar  with the technical questions they were asking, and second the interviewer being determined to show  how smart they were, specifically smarter than the interviewee.
If someone has a bad experience  interviewing with you, they are highly unlikely to accept your offer.
Three, be prepared to  talk in some detail about your company culture, because almost every candidate is going to  ask you that question, "What's it like to work here? What's your company culture like?"  I think we've seen a particular uptick in this question over the past year. Frankly  a lot of the stuff around Uber and a lot of the focus around the  culture around the technology industry in Silicon Valley is making people, especially individuals, think more  about the kind of culture they want to work in.
Two specific bits of advice  here.
I'd definitely be prepared to answer questions about how you think about diversity, if  your team's already diverse or not, I think you should have some thought around how  you plan on incorporating that into your hiring practices going forward. Second, when you're describing  your culture, be aware that almost every company, a significant majority, essentially use three adjectives:  open, transparent, and collaborative. We've seen this on Triplebyte because we've seen them creating their  profiles, right? That can be an effective strategy, because all three of those things are  good aspirational qualities. No one would not want to work at an open, transparent, collaborative  place. But it's not very good for differentiating yourself, right? One strategy you could take  when you're talking about your culture is take more risk.
An example of risk might  be talk about the trade-offs in your culture. So if you believe yourself to be  an open culture, talk about the trade-off there. Openness means being honest about things and  being honest about things can be difficult and uncomfortable for people.
If you're willing to  go in that direction, you may alienate some candidates but you may also really increase  your closing rate on the candidates that are most excited about you. Fourth, get your  team and investors involved in the process. So once you've made an offer, make sure  your team reaches out afterwards, offers to meet up with the candidate again, answer more  questions and generally be involved in their decision making process.
And do the same with  investors, in particular, pick any investors you have who would be particularly good at closing  that candidate. So if they're on the fence about whether to leave a big company  for your startup, do you have an investor that successfully left a big company and  joined a successful startup? Finally, present full and transparent offers, with all the details the  candidate needs to understand how much they're being compensated.
This sounds, again, probably somewhat obvious.  But I've been surprised by seeing companies engage in this sort of hypothetical battle where  instead of just telling a candidate, "here's how much salary and equity you get" posing  questions like, "How excited are you about us? If we made you an offer do  you think you'd join?" And this always creates a bad, awkward candidate experience.
It's also  unfair because the truth is, no matter how powerful your mission is, compensation is a  big factor in where someone is going to work. So asking them to commit before  giving them details is just ... Puts them in an uncomfortable position and decreases the  chances that they would accept your offer to join. When you do make the offer,  provide full details.
This slide has, I'd say the minimum of what you should put  on an offer letter. Salary is fairly self-explanatory. With equity, make sure that when you  present the details of an equity offer, so the number of stock options, exercise price,  etc.
That you're also checking in to ask the candidate how comfortable are they with  this.
If they're a senior engineer, and they've worked at 6 or 7 different startups,  they probably understand this, you don't have to go into too much detail.
If they've  spent most of their life working at Intel, they may not be familiar with how  startup equity works. So ask them how comfortable they are, don't overwhelm them when you  present the offer details if they're not. Just send them follow up resources, that they  can read on their own time.
Also, this sounds sort of obvious, but make sure  you yourselves as founders really understand how stock options work, because people will ask you  questions about it and you actually don't end up spending much time on this because  you, yourself have restricted stock and fundraising doesn't usually include options. But you should understand,  even down to the level of let's say, tax implications, of different types of options.  Final thing I'm gonna say in close on here is a common thing that comes  up for startups is how do you compete for engineers against the tech giants like  Google and Facebook, in particular. So Google and Facebook obviously can offer much larger liquid  compensation packages than a startup can and frankly the public tech company stocks have been  doing great over the last few years, so it's been becoming more challenging to compete  against them. Still, we routinely see startups do it and win out against much larger  companies offering more money.
I think there's four pitches they make that have been quite  compelling.
The first is emphasize learning.
The case I make here is that you learn  the most, or you learn the fastest when you're given real decision making responsibility, which  means if you make a mistake, like bad shit happens.
And there's very, very little  chance, practically no chance, that that's gonna happen at a big company. Big companies have  checks and balances in place to make sure that no one can create too much  damage, in particular for new hires. So if you tell someone that "hey, we just  don't have that luxury. We're growing quickly, we've gotta get everything shipped yesterday, you're gonna  get thrown straight in to making really decision making authority and if you screw up  that's gonna be bad for the company and that's the way that you learn and  build real experience." So, emphasize that.
Two, I talk about career progression. One sort of  macro comment I'd make is, if you look at executives at public technology companies, they  tend to be or often can be much younger than you'd see at their counterparts  at a public [inaudible] or a public utilities company, right? And the reason for that  is you can grow up and be Chief Product Officer at Facebook at 38, or  however old the Chief Product Officer is, because you joined the startup when it was  really early, and you grew along with it, right? The tech industry is really the  only place that happens.
It's more of a meritocracy, you don't have to pay your  20 year dues at a company before they consider you for a senior role, you  can rise up as quickly as the startup grows. So, emphasize that.
Third, talk about  opportunity cost.
In particular the way I'd frame this or talk about this would be  at any given moment in time, there's always going to be a basket of big,  safe technology companies to go work at.
Their names might change every five years or  so, but the experience of working at one is largely fungible. Whereas, the experience of  working at a startup varies wildly. So I would emphasize the fact that your startup  right now, the team you have, the opportunity, is a unique one that's a uniquely  good fit for that candidate that they won't get again.
And if it doesn't work  out, they can always go back to generic big company. Final point.
This one's specific  to hiring more junior candidates.
Talk about mentorship. One thing that we see, especially for  new grads, people straight out of college, is that they're worried they won't get the  right amount of mentorship, they won't learn how the best practices work if they join  a startup.
And maybe they should go work at Google for a few years, get  that under their belt, and then join a startup.
I mean, first decide if that's  actually true or not.
If you yourself have only junior engineers on your team, and  frankly you just don't want to mentor or get someone up to speed, then don't  make that case and maybe don't hire someone like that. But if you have experienced  engineers on your team, emphasize that and emphasize the fact that they will get to  learn alongside experienced engineers that have worked at places and learned best practices etc. Etc.  So, that's everything.
I think we're gonna open up for questions. We'll answer questions about  the topics we covered. Do you wanna come up? yeah.
Speaker 4: This is obviously more of engineering and tech focused discussion but can you maybe talk  about things like background checks, and things that totally rule out a candidate?
Harj Taggar: Like background, things that rule out the candidate?
Speaker 4: Like, to even consider doing background checks or-
Harj Taggar: Background checks ... Frankly most startups I know don't do them.
They're especially easy to  do now, though, because you can integrate Checker in with your payroll service, so sure,  but that's not something that I would focus on.
I'd focus more on is someone  going to be a good fit or not? Yeah.
Speaker 5: I have a computer science junior who wants to intern for me.
I don't have  any engineers on the team [inaudible] , given that I only need to get a  [inaudible] . What would you do?
Ammon Bartram: That's a hard question. So, the majority of computer science juniors are probably not going  to be able to do a particularly good job of doing the work you want.  That said, this sounds like a case where you could probably just evaluate past work  this person has done. So you could probably ask this person to give you a  portfolio, or other examples of work they've done, and if that is at a level  and of a type that you're happy with, hiring them would probably work.
Speaker 6: Is there any benefit that you could actually use to help make a better decision  when it comes on to hiring people, like Myers-Briggs or probably [inaudible] ?
Ammon Bartram: Yeah probably. So, the thing we focus on is background blind hiring, so we focus  very narrowly on just direct skills assessment rather than looking at other things that correlate  and are predictive, so personality type is real, people vary in their personality, so that  stuff matters for performing jobs, I think it's more research on the big five personality  traits rather than Myers-Briggs.
All relevant, but I would try to keep it pretty separate  from technical assessment. So assess technical attributes, and then separately try to assess culture, friendliness,  soft skills.
And then combine that all and try to make a global decision.
Harj Taggar: Yeah. Sorry, back in the sunglasses.
Speaker 7: So after like [inaudible] .
If I wanna find the right technical, I know you  guys sort through numerous tools and the ways that you guys get an engineer on  board and give them like problems. But if I'm not technical, how could I gauge  if the person is actually qualified if I'm not experienced with that?
Ammon Bartram: That's the extreme version, and I'm just gonna say you probably can't. So the question  is, if you're a non-technical founder, how can you assess an applicant's technical skills? And  I think the answer, unfortunately, is that you probably can't. So you can fall back  on the advice of trying to look at past work, but I think this is  why it's very helpful to have a technical co-founder, is because you are gonna be  at a fundamental disadvantage there.
Speaker 7: I mean as far as finding a candidate goes not [inaudible] either that or [inaudible]  .
Ammon Bartram: Yeah, I ... You have a thought there?
Harj Taggar: The question is how do you find a technical co-founder and figure out if they're  good or not? I think Ammon's advice basically applies here.
The most thing is, use  a friend or someone that you know who is an engineer to talk to them  and figure out if they're a good engineer or not. Otherwise, there's not really any  other options. Yep. Yep.
Apparently I'm not precise with my pointing.
I need to work  on that.
Speaker 8: Question about talent generation, so like the step before sourcing.
Is there any methods around  working with universities and you'd probably face challenges with them? Or some kind of mechanism  for sourcing that might be a good way of building talent rather than outsourcing?
Harj Taggar: Yes, but I think this is largely focused ... Oh, sorry. Reviewing the question.
The  question is are there ways to work with the universities and colleges to generate like  a pipeline of talent that you could hire from, is that accurate? I'd say yes,  there certainly are and they exist like career fairs and sponsored events at colleges etc.  etc. But I think those probably work better for larger companies that can fit themselves  around the college graduation deadlines and that schedule. For startups its kinda tough 'cause usually  you want someone that's available right now to hire as opposed to waiting for them  to graduate. So I probably wouldn't recommend investing too much time in that as a  startup.
Ammon Bartram: And just to clarify, big companies at this point make offers a full year in  advance with large signing bonuses delivered a year in advance, so it's very hard for  startups to compete with college hiring.
Speaker 9: So you talked about role playing a bad interviewer.
I'm just curious as to why  a bad interview rather than [inaudible] and making mistakes.
Ammon Bartram: Yeah. So the question is to really clarify on my last point about role playing  a bad interview. So the key point here is that you're gonna role play the  interview and the coworker who's playing the candidate, who's giving the answers, they're going to  intentionally make some mistakes.
And what that does is, it frees up their coworker to  be critical. So normally, if you do a mock interview between two coworkers, the problem  is that in the end, everyone is gonna pull their punches.
They're not gonna honestly  give their opinion of the performance that their coworker gave.
It just doesn't quite work  due to all kinds of social pressure.
If you tell them, I'm gonna be intentionally  making some mistakes, that frees them up where they're then free to point out the  flaws in your interview. Not only free to, they have to. Because if you say,  “I'm making mistakes,” and you ask them “what's your opinion of my results?” If they  don't point at a mistake you made, that means you got something past them, right?  So it flips the social pressure and creates pressure where they're then incentivized to be  critical, which is extremely useful because as experienced engineers, it's been a while ... You're  a senior engineer on a team at a successful company, it's been a while since  you've had someone really brutally critique how good you are at answering your own questions.  What will happen is that they will point out legitimate flaws. You'll be trying to  give your best answer and they will point out things you said that are wrong  or things that could be better and that, it's very humbling.
It's very humbling and  I recommend ...
I think this is an exercise where you can give yourself that  experience of being humbled and having flaws in your own performance pointed out.
Geoff Ralston: Okay guys. Sorry, due to the timing, just one more question please.
Harj Taggar: In the middle, yes. Got it.
Speaker 10: You talked about a 95% loss success rate on one of the slides and given  the fact that the interviewers tend not to have a very high inter-rater reliability, it  seems hard to believe that there's a 95% ...
I mean it also doesn't match  my experience, that 95% of the hires were successful. So, what do you think is  the real success rate where a year after hire somebody's still there and they're a  top performer?
Ammon Bartram: Yeah.
That's gonna be ... So that number 95 comes from some surveys we did  of companies. Okay, sorry. So the question was, in one of my slides, I said  that hires are successful 95% of the time. But that doesn't mesh with the experience  of being a hiring manager and hiring people. Many of the people you hire are  not great. So the question is, what's the actual rate at which candidates end up  being top performers? Question is totally right. So that number comes from some surveys we  did where we asked companies of all their hires, what percentage got fired? And we  actually asked what percentage are top performers and that 5% is the fire rate. So  5% actually get fired, an additional 30% are people who stick on but are not  truly great employees.
And then about 10% are in the bucket that companies said were  their best hires and top performers.
Geoff Ralston: Okay, thank-you guys so much.
