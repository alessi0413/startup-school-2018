# A Conversation with Ooshma Garg - Moderated by Adora Cheung

#与Ooshma Garg的对话-由张阿多拉主持

- Thank you for coming today. My name's Adora. I'm one of the partners here at Y Combinator, and today we're gonna talk with, have a conversation with Ooshma Garg, who's the CEO and founder of Gobble, which creates and delivers 15-minute pan dinners to you. I am, personally, a happy customer. It's great for people who don't have time to do grocery shopping, prep ingredients, actually cook, and then clean up afterwards, so. So, Gobble started in 2011, and while it's doing pretty well today, it's growing around 100 million revenue per week, I believe. It's gone through its many ups and downs, and so with Ooshma today I wanted to talk to her about couple things. One is the evolution of her business. She's mostly been in the food business, but it's iterated her business model many times, and so I think it'd be interesting to talk about that, and then two is something she's an expert in, which is grit and determination. I think she's one of the few people that I've seen that just never gives up, and so I think grit and determination are one of the qualities many people think they have, but when shit hits the fan, things start to fall apart, and so I think it's also interesting to talk about. So, with that, I would love to welcome Ooshma to the stage. Thank you.

-谢谢你今天来.我叫阿多拉。我是Y Combinator公司的合伙人之一，今天我们将与Ooshma Garg交谈，他是Gobble公司的首席执行官和创始人，该公司为您创造并提供15分钟的平底锅晚餐。就我个人而言，我是一个快乐的顾客。对于那些没有时间买东西、准备食材、真正做饭，然后再打扫卫生的人来说，这是很棒的，所以。所以，Gobble开始于2011年，虽然它今天表现不错，但我相信它的每周收入增长了大约1亿美元。它经历了许多起起落落，所以今天我想和她谈谈几件事。一个是她生意的发展。她主要从事食品业，但它多次重复她的商业模式，所以我认为谈论这件事会很有趣，然后有两件事她是专家，那就是勇气和决心。我认为她是我见过的少数几个永不放弃的人之一，所以我认为勇气和决心是很多人认为他们所具备的品质之一，但是当屎击中球迷时，事情就开始分崩离析了，所以我认为谈论它也很有趣。因此，我很高兴欢迎乌希玛上台。谢谢。

- [Ooshma] Thanks for having me.

-[Ooshma]谢谢你邀请我

- Thanks. So, welcome, Ooshma.

-谢谢欢迎你，乌希玛。

- Thank you for having me.

谢谢你邀请我

- Thank you for coming. So, maybe we can just briefly start from the very beginning. You were a student at Stanford, and I believe you started your first company then, which was, correct me if I got this wrong, is you helped students get jobs at banks and other companies, so.

-谢谢你能来所以，也许我们可以从一开始就简单地开始。你是斯坦福大学的学生，我相信你在那时候创办了你的第一家公司，如果我搞错了，那就是你帮助学生在银行和其他公司找到工作，所以。

- Yes, yes.

-是的，是的。

- Obviously that didn't work out, and you did Gobble instead, but can you explain why that didn't work out, and what made you think that you should just move on from that idea.

-很明显，这是行不通的，而你只做了Gobble，但你能解释一下为什么没有成功，以及是什么让你认为你应该从这个想法出发。

- Sure. So, back when I was at Stanford, I started this company out of my dorm room, and a fun visual is that I had this like 150, 200-square-foot room with no space, and I lofted my bed like five inches from the ceiling, and stuffed some like IKEA desks under my bed. We could only fit like three desks in there. I was a junior, so I hired all these freshmen, really smart freshmen as interns, and got a boyfriend so I could sleep somewhere else, for the business, joking, and then our dorm room became our office, and I hid the key in the girls' bathroom, and people would come between class, and get the key from my pink shower caddy, and then go into my dorm room and work on our startup. So, that was our, that was my first company, Anapata, and the idea was to help students get jobs. I was head of this group, Stanford Women in Business, so we were matching people to banks, and law firms, and consulting firms, and I worked on that for three years. I bootstrapped it, and no one would fund me. They told me the idea was too niche, or what have you, but really, no one was using LinkedIn at the time, and all of these students are looking for work, so I thought that we could really be the LinkedIn for students, and it was all centered around their interests and student groups. Long story short, the idea was working, and we were making money. These companies would write us $20,000, $25,000 checks for annual subscriptions to my recruiting website, and it was a two-sided marketplace, so what really happened is, first of all, I poured everything I had into the business, and my health went down the drain, which later leads to Gobble, but what ended up happening is I learned the hard lesson that whoever pays you kind of owns you, and determines how your product evolves. So, theses banks, and consulting firms, and all of them, were paying me, and they wanted to recruit students based on quotas, based on like their GPA, or their race, or other parts of their background that didn't really have to do with if they were a good cultural match. So, anyways, I was making money, but the mission, and the initial vision, and all of that, of the business, of helping people find good jobs, wasn't true anymore. So, I actually got to a very dark place, and ended up selling the business. So, it could have worked, and it could have worked longer-term, but it wasn't the business I initially intended, and I'm not the kind of person who is just gonna do something to make money. I wanna do something that I believe in.

-当然。所以，当我在斯坦福大学的时候，我在宿舍里创办了一家公司，有趣的是，我有一个150，200平方英尺的房间，没有空间，我把我的床像离天花板5英寸的地方放了起来，然后把一些像宜家的桌子塞到我的床下。我们只能在里面放三张桌子。我当时是个三年级学生，所以我雇了所有这些新生，非常聪明的一年级学生做实习生，然后我找了个男朋友，这样我就可以在别的地方睡觉，做生意，开玩笑，然后我们的宿舍变成了我们的办公室，我把钥匙藏在女生的浴室里，人们会在上课之间，从我的粉红色淋浴球童那里拿到钥匙，然后进入我的寝室，在我们的创业公司工作。那是我们的，那是我的第一家公司，Anapata，这个想法是为了帮助学生找到工作。我是这个小组的负责人，斯坦福妇女在商业，所以我们把人与银行，律师事务所，和咨询公司，我在这方面工作了三年。我偷了它，没人会资助我。他们告诉我，这个想法太利基了，或者你有什么，但实际上，当时没有人在使用LinkedIn，所有这些学生都在找工作，所以我认为我们真的可以成为学生的LinkedIn，它都围绕着他们的兴趣和学生群体。长话短说，这个想法奏效了，我们在赚钱。这些公司会给我的招聘网站写两万到两万五千美元的年度订阅支票，这是一个双向的市场，所以真正发生的是，首先，我把我所有的一切都投入到了这个行业中，我的健康状况一败涂地，这后来导致了Gobble，但最终发生的是，我学到了一个艰难的教训，无论是谁付钱给你，都是你的所有者，并决定了你的产品是如何发展的。所以，这些银行，咨询公司，以及所有这些公司，都付钱给我，他们想根据配额招聘学生，比如他们的平均绩点，或者他们的种族，或者他们的其他背景，如果他们是一个好的文化匹配的话，这和他们的背景没有什么关系。所以，无论如何，我是在赚钱，但我的使命，最初的愿景，以及所有这些，帮助人们找到好工作，都不再是真的了。所以，我去了一个很黑暗的地方，最后把生意卖掉了。所以，这是可行的，也可能是长期的，但这不是我最初打算做的事情，我不是那种只想赚钱的人。我想做些我相信的事。

- Who did you sell it to?

-你卖给谁了？

- So, in our third year, we were taking off with law firms. There are thousands of law firms, and only tens of banks on Wall Street, and so I sold it to a company called LawWorks, and basically they're a recruiting company and software, and they wanted to add community to their offering. At that time, it was like 2010, and social, and communities, and all of that, were not as common as they are now.

-所以，在我们的第三年里，我们开始与律师事务所合作。华尔街有成千上万家律师事务所，只有几十家银行，所以我把它卖给了一家叫LawWorks的公司，基本上他们是一家招聘公司和软件，他们想在他们的服务中加入社区。那时候，就像2010年，社会、社区和所有的一切，都不像现在那么普遍了。

- So, you mentioned, briefly, this is a good transition into, maybe talking about Gobble in the beginning. Your health was going down the drain. How did that actually turn into Gobble itself?

-所以，你简短地提到，这是一个很好的过渡，也许在一开始就谈到了Gobble。你的健康正在恶化。它是如何变成Gobble本身的呢？

- Yeah. I'm sure, as you all are too familiar with, starting a company, at least, especially in the first 1,000 days, is very, very lonely. Very few people believe in the idea outside of yourself, and most people think you're crazy. Most people don't care about you, and so you're the only thing that keeps yourself going, and maybe your cofounder, your partner, but your partner's sick of hearing about it, and your cofounder may or may not work out, so there's lots of loneliness, and basically, this... I became just very insular. I stopped visiting my family and my friends. I was working on the business, but I was staying up too late, and then waking up too late, and then just eating like all this takeout, and soda, and I think it not only affects your physical health, and I gained a lot of weight, but it also affects your mental health. So, all of that came to a head when my dad insisted on visiting, and I was here in California. My parents are in Texas, and my dad is the head of nutrition at UT Southwestern in Texas, so he's spent 30 years of his life studying diabetes, obesity, and nutrition, and then, at home, he would make sure we all ate home-cooked food, and real good food, so, and your parents always know when something's wrong. You can't lie to them, so. So, it's just a matter of time, so. So, anyways, he got on a plane. Actually, first he cooked for three days, and made all of this home-cooked Indian food, stuffed it in these international suitcases that were nicely packed and checked in. Everything's in foil, and ziplocks, and whatever, flew here to California to my little dingy studio apartment, and without even saying hello, comes in the apartment, goes to the fridge, and starts stuffing the food in the fridge, and it just showed his anger, and sadness, and emotion about me not taking care of myself, and how bad things had gotten, and he warmed a little plate of some sabzi, which is a vegetable Indian dish, with some bread and rice, and just put it in front of me, and I had this IKEA two-person dining table in a corner, and I ate this first bite, and I just started crying uncontrollably because the food was so good, and it showed me how much I had lost, and it wasn't just nutrition, it was a sense of self and being, and that's really easy to do, and so anyways, that first bite of my dad's home cooking inspired Gobble, and that moment was when I decided that home cooking, and the sense of a family dinner, is very important to me.

-是啊我敢肯定，因为你们都太熟悉了，创办一家公司，至少在最初的1000天里，是非常孤独的。很少有人相信自己以外的想法，而且大多数人认为你疯了。大多数人都不关心你，所以你是唯一能让自己继续前进的人，也许是你的共同创始人，你的伴侣，但你的伴侣已经厌倦了这件事，而你的联合创始人可能会或不会成功，所以会有很多孤独，基本上，这.我变得很孤僻。我停止拜访我的家人和朋友。我在做生意，但我熬夜太晚，醒来太晚，然后像吃外卖和苏打水一样吃东西，我认为它不仅影响你的身体健康，我还长了很多体重，还影响了你的心理健康。所以，当我爸爸坚持要来看我的时候，这一切都到了极点，而我当时在加利福尼亚。我的父母在德克萨斯州，我爸爸是德克萨斯州UT西南大学的营养主管，所以他花了30年的时间研究糖尿病、肥胖症和营养，然后，在家里，他会确保我们都吃家里煮的食物和真正好的食物，所以，你的父母总是知道什么时候出了问题。你不能骗他们所以。所以，这只是时间问题，所以。总之，他上了飞机。实际上，首先他做了三天的饭，做了所有这些家常便饭，把它塞进了这些国际手提箱里，这些箱子都装得很好。所有的东西都是箔纸，拉链什么的，都飞到了加利福尼亚，来到我肮脏的小公寓，甚至连招呼都不打个招呼，就进了公寓，走到冰箱前，开始往冰箱里塞食物，只显示出他对我不照顾自己的愤怒、悲伤和情绪，以及事情变得多么糟糕，于是他温暖了一小盘苦瓜，这是一种印度蔬菜，配上一些面包和米饭，放在我面前，我在角落里有一张宜家(宜家)两人餐桌，我吃了第一口，我开始忍不住哭，因为食物太好吃了，它告诉我失去了多少，这不仅仅是营养，它是一种自我和存在的感觉，这真的很容易做，所以无论如何，我爸爸的第一口家常菜启发了Gobble，那一刻我决定在家做饭和家庭晚餐的感觉对我来说是非常重要的。

- So, the first version of Gobble, if I got it correctly, it was a marketplace for people to create home-cooked meals and sell it on the marketplace. So, that was 2011, and then, I believe, then, one year later, you turned it into, if I have this, I have it written down, catering.

-所以，第一个版本的Gobble，如果我正确的话，它是一个市场，为人们创造家庭熟食，并在市场上出售。所以，那是2011年，然后，我相信，一年后，你把它变成，如果我有这个，我写下来，饮食。

- Yes.

-是的。

- And then, year later, it was personalized dinner service, and then, to what it is, pretty much what it is today,

-然后，一年后，它是个性化的晚餐服务，然后，它是什么，几乎是今天，

- Yes.

-是的。

- 10, 15-minutes dinner kits. So, maybe you could start off with, if you remember your one-liner for each four of those business models, to help us distinguish the difference between those four.

-10分钟，15分钟-晚餐包所以，也许你可以从，如果你记得你的四种商业模式中的一条线，来帮助我们区分这四种模式之间的区别。

- Absolutely. I definitely remember the first one, because it's what I raised our seed round off of. So, we started, after I ate that food, I wanted to replicate my dad in the Bay Area, and I posted on Craigslist, and looked for moms or dads that would cook for me. Anyway, the way that we described the idea, it ultimately became a marketplace for personal chefs and families, and we described it as peer-to-peer lasagne, and everyone remembered that, and just said it, and it was catchy, and weird, and the peer-to-peer economy was really hot at the time. Airbnb was just coming up. Etsy was coming up, and there were all these rental or sharing startups in 2010 to 2012. So, that's how we described the marketplace. Catering was just like home-cooked food for office. The personalized dinner service was exactly that. It was meals, personalized exactly to your tastes, and our current dinner kits, we describe as, just as a meal-prep service, 15-minute, one-pan cooking.

-绝对是我肯定记得第一次，因为这是我把我们的种子培育出来的原因。所以，我们开始了，在我吃完这些食物后，我想在湾区复制我的爸爸，然后我在Craigslist上发了帖子，寻找能为我做饭的妈妈或爸爸。不管怎么说，我们描述这个想法的方式，它最终变成了一个个人厨师和家庭的市场，我们把它描述为点对点千层面，每个人都记得这一点，大家都这么说，它很吸引人，很奇怪，当时的点对点经济非常火爆。Airbnb刚来。Etsy即将上市，2010年到2012年，所有这些租赁或共享创业公司都出现了。这就是我们对市场的描述。餐饮业就像办公室里的家常便饭。个性化的晚餐服务就是这样。这是一顿饭，完全符合你的口味，我们现在的套餐包，我们把它描述为，就像一种餐前服务，15分钟，一个平底锅烹饪。

- So, everyone who built a product always remembers their very first user who wasn't their mom, or dad, or family. Do you remember that person, and what was he or she like?

因此，每个生产产品的人都记得他们的第一个用户，他们不是他们的妈妈、爸爸或家人。你还记得那个人吗？他或她是什么样的人？

- Yeah. So, recently I met one of our very first like 10 users. The guy's name is Shealtiel, and it's really funny. I actually met him, and he was a user of ours in 2011. So, now it's some seven, eight years later. I met him a few weeks ago at a wedding in New York, and he was like, "Are you Ooshma?" I was like, Yeah. And he was like, "I used to eat your food." And your product goes through so many iterations that when someone remembers the first website of yours, and all those bugs and things, it's really special. He was a Stanford student, and he would email us pages of feedback every time he tried the food, and so it was kind of the canonical early adopter, that someone who really wants to work with you, and who wants to help improve your company, and make it good for them and for everybody else.

-是啊所以，最近我遇到了我们的第一批用户之一，大约10个用户。这家伙的名字叫萨拉蒂尔，真的很有趣。实际上我见过他，他在2011年也是我们的用户。所以，现在已经是七八年后了。几周前我在纽约的一个婚礼上遇见他，他说：“你是乌希玛吗？”我就像，是的。他说，“我以前吃过你的食物。”你的产品经历了太多的反复，以至于当有人记得你的第一个网站，以及所有这些bug和东西时，它真的很特别。他是斯坦福大学的学生，他每次尝试食物时都会给我们发电子邮件反馈信息，所以这是一个典型的早期采用者，一个真正想和你一起工作的人，他想帮助改善你的公司，让它对他们和其他人都有好处。

- So, in the beginning, you also did a lot of unscalable things to get users. I read you did promo cars everywhere. You went to Starbucks and, I guess, bothered people

-所以，在一开始，你也做了很多不可伸缩的事情来吸引用户。我听说你到处都在推销汽车。你去了星巴克，我想是打扰了别人

- Yes, yes.

-是的，是的。

- To order from Gobble. So, a lot of those things probably didn't work, but anything that you remember that actually worked.

-从Gobble订购。所以，很多事情可能都不起作用，但是你记得的任何事情都是有效的。

- Yeah. There are two things that worked, and I was reflecting on this. One of them is, I guess, the things that work is, when you're just starting out, you can't throw a million dollars into Facebook ads in one week, but it doesn't also work to just talk to 10 individuals. That's too unscalable. So, it's all about reaching microgroups. One thing I did is, I would go to my fave, I went to all my favorite shops, like coffee shops, restaurants, laundromats, whatever, and I actually bought card holders on like a whatever, equipment website, and made promo cards that were business-card size, and it said, like, two free dinners, Gobble.com, and it had the restaurant's name on the back. One of the first valuable innovations, or features, that we released into our product was the ability to accept promo codes, because attribution of your growth is extremely important from day one, or else I can't tell you what's working or not working. So, there's ZombieRunners on California Avenue, it's this coffee shop, and it's inside a running store, that used to be a movie theater. It's very weird. You should go there. It's my favorite coffee shop, and so, they put a little thing at their register, and it turned out to be more effective than the nail salons, the laundromats, anything else. Another YC company order-ahead, actually, for a while, was very successful with coffee shops, and promos, and ordering at coffee shops. One other thing was, I spoke to as many meetup groups, or moms groups, and neighborhood groups, as possible, and I would get them, I would always try to have an offer that was, I tested offers, and I knew what would work, so every single one of them would send my offer on their email list, and it had to be an email with your offer to a group, and that converted.

-是啊有两件事起作用了，我在想这件事。其中之一，我想，最有效的是，当你刚开始工作的时候，你不能在一周内向Facebook的广告投入一百万美元，但是仅仅和10个人交谈也是行不通的。那太不可伸缩了。所以，这一切都是为了接触微群体。我做的一件事是，我会去我最喜欢的商店，比如咖啡店，餐馆，洗衣店，什么的，我实际上是在一个随便的设备网站上买了卡片持有者，制作了名片大小的宣传卡，上面写着，就像两顿免费晚餐，Gobble.com，它的背面写着餐馆的名字。我们在产品中发布的第一批有价值的创新或特性之一是接受广告代码的能力，因为从第一天起，你成长的原因是非常重要的，否则我就不能告诉你什么在起作用，什么不起作用。加州大道上有ZombieRunners，这是一家咖啡店，在一家跑步商店里，那里曾经是一家电影院。很奇怪。你应该去那里。这是我最喜欢的咖啡店，所以，他们在他们的登记簿上放了一个小东西，结果证明它比美甲沙龙，洗衣店，任何其他的东西都更有效。另一家YC公司的订单-事实上，在一段时间内，通过咖啡店和促销，以及在咖啡店的订购-非常成功。另一件事是，我和尽可能多的会议团体、妈妈团体和社区团体进行了交谈，我会得到他们，我总是试着得到一个提议，我测试过这个提议，我知道什么是有效的，所以他们每个人都会把我的提议发到他们的电子邮件列表上，它必须是一封电子邮件，上面写着你的提议，然后转换成这样。

- The attribution point is very, I think, key there, which is, even if you're doing a spray-and-pray method of just like, everyone use me, at least you know, when they come in the door, where they actually thought of you.

-我认为，关键在于，即使你在做一种喷雾祈祷的方法，比如，每个人都会用我，至少你知道，当他们进来的时候，他们真的在想你。

- Absolutely, yes.

-当然，是的.

- Cool. So, again, and going back to the evolution of the business, at what point in each of the business models did you realize, oh, this isn't it, I gotta think of something else?

-酷所以，再回到企业的发展过程，在每一种商业模式中，你在什么时候意识到，哦，这不是，我还得想点别的东西呢？

- Right. The funny thing is that, and so first of all, we talked about these business models. All of that was going on from 2011 to 2014. So, between three and a half years, which is still roughly that 1,000 days of finding product-market fit, we had four different iterations to the product, and this is a minor little point, but I know that, I think Michael Seibel spoke recently, and he said that, he talked about the difference between pivoting and iterating, and I thought that was really important, because people say Gobble pivoted, but we didn't pivot. We didn't turn into some online video game. We just iterated, and then found success. So, I think that nuance is important, because pivoting, I think, you don't carry a lot of your learnings with you. Iterating is always building on your previous learnings. So, with these business models, and different iterations and launches, they all failed for different reasons. We had a marketplace first, and everyone loved the food, because it was this authentic, small-batch, home-cooked food from real people: Italian grandmas, and Mexican moms, and Ethiopian chefs, and things, and food you can't get anywhere else, that's not ruined by capitalism, I guess. Anyways, that food wasn't scalable. So, we started getting success with that marketplace idea, but when I asked this Italian mom in San Carlos to make me 200 of her lasagne, when she used to make 20 a day, it wasn't fun anymore, and she didn't wanna make 200, and she wasn't a caterer. So, that model... Airbnb is a peer-to-peer model that can scale, and it's sharing an asset. It's sharing a space. This is a peer-to-peer model that has a lot of breakpoints at scale, of quality, time, capacity, and so on. So, that's why the marketplace model didn't work. We were supply-constrained, not by the number of chefs, but by the juice we could squeeze from each of our SKUs on the marketplace. Then we pivoted to catering, because we had built that marketplace with seed funding, and we maybe had like a half a year of money left, or something, but one of our investors was very insistent that we pad our growth with money, and we do something that'll definitely make us money, and so I went into the catering world. Frankly, to me, I think it's very easy, and I didn't really want to do it. You just get, we got Box.net, and Pinterest, and these companies signed on, and they rarely quit, and so you're just making this money in the background. We did that. We made good money, and we showed growth, but the problem is that when we went to raise series A, the investors asked, how much of your money is from families, and the model you're pitching, and how much of your money is from catering and from enterprise? And at that point, some 75% was from enterprise, because when you do something like that, like the previous startup lesson we learned, all your attention goes to what's giving you the most money, and so that really sucked, because unless I wanted to build a catering business, then I wasn't gonna get funding. So, we were in a pinch then, and I had to raise a bridge round, and wind down the catering business, which was hugely unpopular, because we were making lots of money, but it wasn't my long-term vision. The vision was that people don't have access to this home-cooked food, and I wanted to crack it, and figure it out, and give it to everyone. So, we wound that down because it wasn't part of the long-term vision. So, then we focused on this personalized dinner service. I still, today, think that the power of personalization, what Amazon brings to e-commerce, and what Netflix and Spotify bring to movies and music, that level of personalization has not taken off in food, and just like Google, with search, the company that cracks it in food, I think, will be the long-term winner, and have all these learnings built on top of each other, to where you build a long-term, sustainable advantage. So, that's what we did with that personalized dinner service. We took these chefs, and then we started using restaurants, and caterers, and we focused on the technology, because that's the talent that we had in our headquarters. We had engineers, and product people. So, we focused on the tech to match, to take, we allowed people to give us whatever taste they wanted, so we ended up getting thousands of picky eaters, and people who didn't eat nightshades, and they were vegan, but they still didn't likes olives, and lettuce, and crazy stuff, and no matter what your tastes were, I said I would feed you, and so anyway, that model really stretched our technology, and by doing the hard thing, we learned.

-对。有趣的是，首先，我们讨论了这些商业模式。所有这些都发生在2011年至2014年。所以，在三年半的时间里，也就是大约1000天的产品市场匹配时间里，我们对产品进行了四次不同的迭代，这是一个小问题，但我知道，我认为迈克尔·塞贝尔(Michael Seibel)最近说过了，他说，他谈到了旋转和迭代之间的区别，我认为这很重要，因为人们说Gobpible投票，但我们没有转向。我们没有变成网络游戏。我们只是重复了一遍，然后找到了成功。所以，我认为细微差别是很重要的，因为我认为，你不会随身带太多的知识。迭代总是建立在您以前学习的基础上。因此，由于这些业务模型以及不同的迭代和启动，它们都因不同的原因而失败。我们首先有了一个市场，每个人都很喜欢这里的食物，因为这是一种真实的，小批量的，来自真人的家常菜：意大利祖母，墨西哥妈妈，埃塞俄比亚厨师，还有其他地方都买不到的食物，我想这不会被资本主义破坏。不管怎么说，那些食物是无法扩展的。所以，我们开始在市场理念上取得成功，但当我让圣卡洛斯的一位意大利妈妈给我做200块她的千层面，当她过去每天做20块的时候，这已经不好玩了，她不想做200块，她也不是一家宴会的承办商。所以那个模型.。Airbnb是一种可以扩展的点对点模式，它正在共享一项资产。它在共享一个空间。这是一个点对点模型，在规模、质量、时间、容量等方面都有很多断点。所以，这就是为什么市场模型不起作用的原因。我们的供应是有限的，不是因为厨师的数量，而是因为我们可以从市场上的每一个SKU榨汁。然后我们转向餐饮，因为我们用种子资金建造了那个市场，我们可能还剩半年的钱，或者什么的，但是我们的一个投资者非常坚持我们用钱来抑制我们的增长，我们做一些肯定会让我们赚钱的事情，所以我进入了餐饮业。坦白地说，对我来说，这很容易，而且我并不是真的想这么做。我们得到了Box.net和Pinterest，这些公司签了名，他们很少辞职，所以你只是在后台赚钱。我们做到了。我们赚了很多钱，我们表现出了增长，但问题是，当我们去筹集A系列的时候，投资者问，你的钱有多少来自家庭，你推销的是什么模式，你的钱有多少来自餐饮和企业？在那个时候，大约75%来自企业，因为当你做类似的事情，就像我们之前学到的创业经验一样，你的注意力都集中在给你最多的钱上，所以这真的很糟糕，因为除非我想要建立一家餐饮业，否则我就得不到资金了。所以，当时我们处于紧要关头，我不得不架起一座桥，结束餐饮业务，这是非常不受欢迎的，因为我们赚了很多钱，但这不是我的长远愿景。我们的愿景是，人们没有机会获得这种家常便饭，我想破解它，把它弄清楚，然后把它送给每个人。所以，我们结束了它，因为它不是长期愿景的一部分。所以，我们把重点放在了个性化的晚餐服务上。今天，我仍然认为个性化的力量，亚马逊给电子商务带来的东西，以及Netflix和Spotify给电影和音乐带来的东西，这种程度的个性化还没有在食品领域得到发展，就像google一样，在搜索领域，我认为，在食品领域破解它的公司将是长期的赢家，所有这些知识都建立在彼此之上，从而建立起长期的、可持续的优势。所以，这就是我们对个性化晚餐服务所做的。我们接受了这些厨师，然后我们开始使用餐馆和餐饮业，我们把注意力集中在技术上，因为这是我们在总部所拥有的才能。我们有工程师和产品人员。所以，我们把重点放在技术上来匹配，采取，我们允许人们给我们任何他们想要的味道，所以我们最终得到了数以千计的挑剔的食客，和那些不吃夜色的人，他们是纯素的，但他们仍然不喜欢橄榄，生菜，和疯狂的东西，不管你的口味如何，我说我会喂你，所以无论如何，这个模型真的延伸了。我们的技术，通过做艰苦的事情，我们学到了。

- If you're a vegan and don't like lettuce, what are you eating?

-如果你是素食主义者，不喜欢生菜，你要吃什么？

- I know. I don't know. Like, lots of beans.

-我知道。我不知道很多豆子。

- So, you moved the business model a little bit each time, or quite a bit, actually, each time

-所以，你每次都会移动一下商业模式，或者说，每次都会有很大的变化。

- Yes.

-是的。

- and so one of the difficult things in doing that is taking the risk, and bringing down your current business for, hopefully, future success, and that, I think, a lot of people actually don't do that because it's very, very scary. They just try keep pushing the current model, trying to make it work. So, was it scary for you, and what was your thought process in actually just saying, no, not gonna do this enterprise catering anymore, even though it's making me tons of money?

-所以做这件事的困难之一就是冒险，为了未来的成功而毁掉你目前的业务，我认为，很多人实际上没有这样做，因为这是非常可怕的。他们只是试着继续推动目前的模式，试图让它发挥作用。那么，这对你来说是可怕的吗？你的想法是什么呢？你只是说，不要再做这个企业餐饮了，尽管它让我赚了很多钱？

- Right, right, it was so scary. It was really scary, and actually, some of our investors would call me into their office, and just use it as, like, me as a punching bag, and sit down at their reclaimed wood table in their kitchenette or something, and they would like, I'd be sitting, and I'd stand up, and they'd be like, and every time there's new startups coming up, the grass is always greener, because the investors know all your problems, and they don't know any of the other problems. So, anyway, so they would be like, "This company, Munchery, is starting, "and this company, OrderAhead, is starting, "and all these companies are starting, "and what are you doing?" and it was much louder, and much worse than that, and so, but you know? I have found, I think that's what you mentioned earlier, about the grit and determination. I don't know if it's learned, or what it is. Over so many years, I have found that I cannot listen to anything, there's nothing more loud than my gut, and it just, when you know something, and you've been in it for three years, or thousands of days, you can't avoid it. You know what you have to do. Other people think about you like 1% of the year, and just in the one-hour meeting, and so I think early on we put a lot of weight into investor meetings, even into YC partner meetings, into all these meetings, and it can really throw you off your game for a few days. You're like, ugh, this one person didn't like my idea. Who am I? And it's just something you have to get through, and I would always try to justify each direction with logic, and with market drawings, and one book that really helped me was Blue Ocean Strategy. It's my favorite business book to date, and it talks about how companies broke through the noise in existing industries. Talks about Southwest Airlines, Yellowtail wine, and some really interesting companies that no one thought would work, and it gives you a framework with which to think about your company, and I would draw that framework, and keep using it as my north star.

-对，太可怕了.这真的很可怕，事实上，我们的一些投资者会把我叫到他们的办公室，就像我一样，用它作为一个沙袋，坐在他们厨房或其他什么地方的填好的木桌旁，他们会喜欢，我会坐下来，我会站起来，他们会喜欢，每次有新的创业公司出现，草总是更绿，因为他们想，我坐着，我站起来，他们会喜欢，每次有新的创业公司出现，草总是更绿，因为投资者知道你所有的问题，他们不知道任何其他问题。所以，不管怎么说，他们会说，“这个公司，蒙奇里，开始了”，而这个公司，OrderAhead，正在开始，“所有这些公司都开始了，”你在做什么呢？而且声音更大，也比那更糟，所以，你知道吗？我发现，我认为这就是你前面提到的关于勇气和决心的问题。我不知道它是不是学到的，或者它是什么。这么多年来，我发现我什么都听不清，没有什么比我的直觉更响亮的了，当你知道一些事情，你已经在里面呆了三年，或者几千天了，你无法避免它。你知道你该怎么做。其他人认为你就像一年中的1%，就在一个小时的会议上，所以我认为我们很早就把很多精力放在投资者会议，甚至YC合作伙伴会议上，在所有这些会议上，它真的会让你在几天内退出你的游戏。你就像，呃，这个人不喜欢我的主意。我是谁？这只是你必须要通过的事情，我总是试图用逻辑和市场图来证明每一个方向，还有一本书真正帮助了我，那就是“蓝海战略”。这是我迄今为止最喜欢的商业书籍，它谈到了公司如何突破现有行业的噪音。谈论西南航空公司，黄尾巴葡萄酒，和一些真正有趣的公司，没有人认为会有效，它给你一个框架来思考你的公司，我会画出这个框架，并继续使用它作为我的北极星。

- In a previous talk, and let me read this so I get it right, you said something pretty insightful, which is, "Product market fit is not just an a-ha moment. "It's the summation of lots of broad experiments "and micro-learnings over many years." Can you briefly expand on that? A common mistake is for people, when they look at product-market fit, is to just look at one metric, and then, if it moves in one direction, then that's good. So, what did you look at the beginning in? How did you visualize this summation of stuff?

-在之前的一次演讲中，让我读一下这篇文章，你说得很有洞察力，那就是，“产品市场的适合不仅仅是一个很好的时刻。”这是许多广泛的实验的总结“和多年来的微观学习。你能简单地详述一下吗？一个常见的错误是，当人们看产品市场的适合度时，只看一个指标，然后，如果它朝一个方向移动，那就好了。那么，你在开头看了什么？你是怎么想象这些东西的总和的？

- Yeah. Ultimately, I think that product-market fit is the center of the Venn diagram of ability to grow, on one side, and retention, on the other side, and so, if you look at our history, in the marketplace model we weren't able to grow because of the chefs. We were supply-constrained. In the personalized dinner model, we actually weren't able to grow really fast because of the customers. Even though it was personalized, the food wasn't better than the best takeout that you could order. So, if you wanna change the world, or change your industry, you have to do something that is materially better, like iPhone-level better than the market. So, people weren't racing to our door, so we didn't have that ability to grow. Our dinner-kit model has the ability to grow and scale, internally and externally, from customer demand, and it also has high retention.

-是啊最终，我认为产品市场的契合是维恩图的中心，一方面是增长能力，另一方面是保持能力，所以，如果你看看我们的历史，在市场模式中，我们无法增长，因为厨师。我们供不应求。在个性化的晚餐模式中，由于顾客的原因，我们实际上无法快速增长。尽管它是个性化的，但食物并不比你能点的最好的外卖更好。所以，如果你想改变世界，或者改变你的行业，你必须做一些物质上更好的事情，比如iphone水平比市场更好。所以，人们没有跑到我们的门口，所以我们没有成长的能力。我们的餐包模型有能力从内部和外部，从客户的需求，并具有较高的保存率和规模。

- So, moving on to, maybe, more about grit and determination. So, in the beginning, at Stanford you were a bioengineering major,

-所以，继续，也许，更多的是关于勇气和决心。所以，一开始，你在斯坦福大学主修生物工程，

- Yes.

-是的。

- so technical, but not a coder. How did you manage actually doing all of this without being technical?

-如此技术性，但不是一个编码器。实际上，你是如何做到这一切的，而不是技术性的呢？

- Yes. Hmm. Well, initially, and everyone is gonna use their skill sets, and I think the one common theme is that, in the first few months you need to prove your concept. You need to have an MVP. You can do that with code. You can do that with sales, whatever. So, I did not know how to code. I learned PHP, but in both my businesses, in the recruiting business and the chef business, or the food business I have now, I made initial sales without a website, and I proved our concept in the first three months, before any other kind of funding. So, with the recruiting business, I did know like Photoshop and design, and I taught myself all of that, and loved it, so I enjoyed that, and I designed these sales packages that would, like, and I made up stuff. I was like gold, platinum, whatever, $20,000, and I would see if people would give it to me, which is very bold, as a college student, and I had a mockup of a website that wasn't built yet, and I took a semester off, and tried, and only did sales, because that was my proof of concept, and my parents said that only if I got a sale could I not go work on Wall Street, which was horrible. So, side note, I didn't get a sale that semester, and I met like maybe 80 or so people through introductions, and I went to go work at Morgan Stanley in 2008, and that horrible summer, and I hated my life. It was like equities trading, and three weeks in, I got a check in the mail for $10,000, 'cause it was the founding customer price from this law firm, and it was like the coolest day of my life. It was revenue. It was validation, and it took me like seven to 10 days to figure out how to quit the internship. People were all like, you'll get blacklisted. You'll never get a job, and I told the head of the program, and he said, you will always have a job here, but you will never come back, and I thought that was weird at the time, and now I fully understand it, and it's because, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, in your heart, in a way. So, anyways, I think the quitting is hard. So, long story short, but it's hard to avoid.

-是的。嗯。一开始，每个人都会使用他们的技能，我认为一个共同的主题是，在最初的几个月里，你需要证明你的概念。你需要一个MVP。你可以用代码做到这一点。不管怎么说，你可以通过销售做到这一点。所以，我不知道怎么编码。我学了PHP，但在我的公司，在招聘业务和厨师业务，或者现在的食品行业，我在没有网站的情况下做了初步的销售，我在前三个月证明了我们的概念，在任何其他类型的资金之前。所以，在招聘业务中，我确实知道Photoshop和设计，我学会了所有这些，我喜欢它，所以我喜欢它，我设计了这些销售包，就像，我编的东西。我就像黄金，白金，不管是什么，两万美元，我想看看人们是否会把它给我，这是非常大胆的，作为一个大学生，我有一个还没有建成的网站的模型，我休息了一个学期，并尝试，只做销售，因为这是我的概念证明，我的父母说，只有当我能得到一个出售，我可以。不去华尔街工作，这太可怕了。所以，顺便说一句，那学期我没有买到任何东西，我通过自我介绍认识了大约80个人，2008年我去摩根士丹利工作，那个可怕的夏天，我讨厌我的生活。就像股票交易，三周后，我收到了一张一万美元的支票，因为这是这家律师事务所的创始客户价格，这是我生命中最酷的一天。那是收入。这是一种验证，我花了7到10天的时间才想出了如何辞去实习的方法。大家都觉得你会被列入黑名单。你永远找不到工作，我告诉项目负责人，他说，你永远在这里有一份工作，但你永远不会回来，我当时觉得很奇怪，现在我完全明白了，这是因为，一旦成为企业家，永远是企业家，在某种程度上。所以，不管怎样，我觉得辞职很难。所以，长话短说，但这是很难避免的。

- So, around 2011, 2014, you had a hard time raising money, correct? So, how did you, I mean, it's three years. How did you fund all of this, and then also, at the same time, what did you spend your days doing? You must have been really... When you can't get money, that's a huge distraction, so how did you focus on your business and keep going?

-所以，在2011年和2014年左右，你很难筹到钱，对吧？你怎么，我是说，三年了。你是如何为这一切提供资金的，同时，你每天都在做些什么呢？你一定是真的.。当你拿不到钱的时候，这是一个巨大的干扰，那么你是如何专注于你的事业并继续前进的呢？

- Yes. So, first of all, over those three and a half years of finding product-market fit, our monthly burn was $40,000, on average. That's pretty low. That's not a fancy office. That's not 10 people. We kept it to about four people, and everyone had to be like cofounder-style generalist, because we were still iterating. So, if you make your burn 40K, you can make your 1.5 million last a while, but we raised two bridge rounds during that time, and there were some investors who refused to invest, some of them who would listen to the next iteration, and invest in me. Both of those bridges were like 200-some K, and one critical thing: there was a time, in 2013, when no one would invest in me, and I was running out of all of my money, and we had like one payroll in the bank. I think our bank was like $8,000 or something, and that's when I did YC. So, I didn't do YC at the beginning of Gobble. I did YC three and a half years into the struggle, when I was, I didn't know I was about to figure it out. Everybody had lost faith, and I'm the only one who had faith, and the only money I could get was from Jessica and P. G., and so I did YC, and they said they would help me raise a series A, they would fund me for three more months, and six months after that, we figured out our 15-minute one-pan dinner kit.

-是的。因此，首先，在这三年半的产品市场上，我们的平均每月烧伤40，000美元。太低了。那不是一间豪华的办公室。不是十个人。我们把它留给了大约四个人，每个人都必须像共同创始人那样多面手，因为我们还在迭代。所以，如果你烧了40K，你可以让150万美元维持一段时间，但我们在这段时间里进行了两轮融资，有一些投资者拒绝投资，其中一些人会听下一次迭代，然后投资我。这两座桥都是200-一些K，还有一件很关键的事情：有一段时间，在2013年，没有人会投资我，我的钱都用完了，我们银行里只有一份工资单。我想我们的银行大概是8，000美元左右，那就是我做YC的时候。所以，我在Gobble一开始就没有做过YC。我做了三年半的斗争，当我还在的时候，我不知道我会想出来。每个人都失去了信心，我是唯一一个有信心的人，我能从杰西卡和P.G.那里得到的钱，所以我做了YC，他们说他们会帮我筹集一个系列A，他们会再给我三个月的资金，六个月后，我们找到了我们15分钟的一锅套餐。

- So, you mentioned you had employees during this hard time. How did you keep them motivated to keep going?

-所以，你说过在这段艰难时期你有员工.你是如何激励他们继续前进的？

- Mm, that's a tough one. I think that there's a lot of turnover in the early days, and even in the later days, after venture financing, and you're learning how to hire execs, but the employees that ended up lasting the longest were by referral, and so there was some shared values, and shared trust there, and I also really clued them into the hard times. Sometimes you think you're protecting people by not telling them, but actually, your closest employees, especially when you're four to six, if you bring them into the challenge, and if they are challenge oriented, they will stay with you, but if you hide it, then they're not really feeling that excitement and that challenge.

-嗯，这是个艰难的决定.我认为在最初的日子里，甚至在后来，在风险投资之后，你会有很多的营业额，你正在学习如何雇佣高管，但是那些持续时间最长的员工都是通过推荐来完成的，所以有一些共同的价值观和共同的信任，我也很清楚他们在艰难时期的处境。有时候你认为你不告诉别人是在保护他们，但实际上，你最亲密的员工，尤其是当你四到六岁的时候，如果你把他们带入了挑战，如果他们是面向挑战的，他们会和你呆在一起，但如果你隐瞒了，他们就不会真正感受到那种兴奋和挑战。

- At one point you said that you got an acquisition off, or one of your investors wanted you to just get acquired by a clothing startup,

-你曾经说过你得到了一笔收购，或者你的一个投资者想让你被一家服装初创公司收购，

- A clothing startup.

-一家服装初创公司。

- which, completely different.

-完全不同

- Yes.

-是的。

- I mean, you're having hard time, and here's, potentially, money in your bank account. What was your thought process in just turning that down?

-我的意思是，你现在很困难，这有可能是你的银行账户里的钱.你的思维过程是怎么拒绝的？

- Yeah. I've thought a lot about this. Right now, even in our space, there's a lot of consolidation, in the food space, in the meal-kit space. If you see the news, it's a very popular drama in the news. I mean, there's all these companies, like Facebook, or Snapchat, or this or that, that have turned down different offers over time, and sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong, judged by society. I just see so much potential in Gobble, and once we, early on, it was just that, early on I turned that clothing startup thing down, in that product-market fit time, because this is what I wanna work on, and I had nothing to lose. I didn't have kids, or whatever, and I just didn't imagine a better life than working on a hard problem, and now we've started doubling or tripling, year on year, and so if someone were to acquire us now, and we can't weather the storm of a bad meal-kit market, I think we're leaving billions on the table.

-是啊这件事我想了很多。现在，即使在我们的空间里，也有很多巩固，在食物空间，在餐包空间。如果你看新闻，那是一部很受欢迎的新闻剧。我的意思是，有很多公司，比如Facebook，Snapchat，或者这个或那个，随着时间的推移拒绝了不同的报价，有时是对的，有时是错的，这是社会的判断。我看到了Gobble公司的巨大潜力，一旦我们一开始就拒绝了服装初创公司，在产品市场适合的时候，因为这是我想要做的，我没有什么可失去的。我没有孩子，或者别的什么，我只是没有想过比解决一个棘手的问题更好的生活，现在我们已经开始每年增加一倍或三倍，所以如果现在有人要收购我们，我们就不能经受一个糟糕的餐盒市场的风暴，我想我们会留下数十亿美元。

- Speaking of competition, there's been billions of dollars in venture funding going into competitors, or so-called competitors like Blue Apron, Plated, and so on and so forth. I mean, you were the original meal-kit company. What do you,

-说到竞争，已经有数十亿美元的风险投资流向竞争对手，或者所谓的竞争对手，比如蓝色阿普隆，镀金等等。我是说，你是最初的饭盒公司。你是什么

- yes. what do you think about? Like, all that money's going over there, but you're like, I'm here, surviving, and I'm growing fast. What's really going in your mind?

-是的。你觉得呢？就像，所有的钱都在那里，但是你就像，我在这里，活下来了，我成长得很快。你脑子里到底在想什么？

- Yeah. Well, we can look at the silver lining of it, which is that necessity breeds invention, and so by not having that much money, we didn't get comfortable, and we had to innovate, and we had to have good numbers. So, I'm not saying that we should all starve our companies, but because we were somewhat cost-starved, I wasn't distracted by lots of fancy things, and I just focused on making all the dollars count, and doing something meaningful.

-是啊好吧，我们可以看看它的一线希望，那就是需要孕育发明，所以由于没有那么多的钱，我们不舒服，我们必须创新，我们必须有好的数字。所以，我并不是说我们都应该饿死我们的公司，但因为我们有点成本饥饿，我没有被许多花哨的东西分散注意力，我只是专注于让所有的钱都发挥作用，并做一些有意义的事情。

- So, you talk a lot about mission, but beyond that, what actually, really, like how did you keep going, over the seven, eight years? Is it genetic? What do you think it really is, beyond just the mission?

-所以，你谈论了很多关于任务的事情，但除此之外，在过去的七、八年里，你到底在做些什么呢？是遗传的吗？你觉得这到底是什么，不仅仅是任务？

- Wow, hmm. Man, maybe it is some kind of like nature-nurture thing. Mission is a big part of it, but with regards to the grit and determination thing, from an early age, I think I just... My parents wanted me to go to this school, this all-girls school, and I hated my current school. I was bullied a lot, and there was bad phrases and racist things on my locker, and bad stuff, and I applied to this girls school in kindergarten, and I didn't get in, and then in 1st grade, and I didn't get in, and in 2nd grade, and I didn't get in, and you had to take this ERB test, and then in those early grades they're asking you like, what's a triangle, or something, and I didn't get in, so I was like, what's going on? And my parents weren't donating, and there's all these other factors, but I didn't know that, and so I kept applying, and like 3rd grade, 4th grade, 5th grade, didn't get in, and I remember one time, my parents were like, the test is coming up. This is for your future. You need to do this, and I was just so mad. I just remember being so defeated, and so distraught, and like I was letting them down, and I didn't wanna take the test. I was like, who needs this school? Forget it! It's stupid! And I took the test, and I still didn't get in, and finally, in 7th grade I got into that school, and it changed my life. I used every resource they had. I started new organizations. I got funding from the principal of the school to start a model UN society, and I saw it in a different way, and I just seized the entire opportunity when I was there, because I knew how special it was, and I worked so hard to get there, and so, somehow, early on, that was one experience, but there were experiences like that, that I just learned that life is about hard work, and it's about lead bullets, and I'm always enamored by these real overnight successes. I think the most overnight successes are like 10 years in the making. There are some flukes that are like one year, or two year, or three years, that the media celebrates in a disproportionate amount, and I'm always very enamored by them, but the only way that I know is this lead bullets, grit, do-not-give-up strategy.

哇哼伙计，也许是某种类似于后天培养的东西。任务是其中很重要的一部分，但是关于勇气和决心的问题，从很小的时候，我就认为我只是.我父母想让我去这所学校，这所女子学校，而我讨厌我现在的学校。我经常被欺负，我的柜子里有不好的词组和种族主义的东西，还有一些不好的东西，我在幼儿园就申请了这个女子学校，我在一年级没进，上了一年级，上了二年级，我没有进，你必须参加这个再培训局考试，然后在他们问你喜欢的那些早期年级，什么是三角，什么的，但我没进去，所以我想，发生了什么事？我的父母没有捐赠，还有很多其他的因素，但我不知道，所以我继续申请，像三年级，四年级，五年级，没有进，我记得有一次，我的父母说，考试就要到了。这是为了你的未来。你得这么做，而我只是太生气了。我只记得被打败了，心烦意乱，就像我让他们失望了，我不想参加考试。我在想，谁需要这所学校？休想!太蠢了！我参加了考试，但我还是没有考上，最后，在七年级的时候，我进入了那所学校，这改变了我的生活。我利用了他们所有的资源。我成立了新的组织。我得到了学校校长的资助，创建了一个模拟联合国社会，我以不同的方式看待它，我只是在那里抓住了整个机会，因为我知道它是多么的特别，我为了达到这个目标而努力工作，所以，在早期，这是一种经历，但也有这样的经历，我刚刚学会了生活。是关于艰苦的工作，是关于铅子弹的，我总是被这些真正的一夜之间的成功所吸引。我认为，一夜之间最成功的事情就像在酝酿10年。有些侥幸，就像一年，两年，或者三年，媒体庆祝得不成比例，我一直很喜欢，但我知道的唯一方法是这种领先的子弹，坚韧，不放弃策略。

- You were a very ambitious 3rd grader.

-你是个很有野心的三年级学生.

- Thank you.

-谢谢

- Kindergartner, too.

-幼儿园老师也是

- Thank you.

-谢谢

- I wish we had known you back then. We would have just predicted all of this and funded you all the way back in kindergarten.

-我希望我们那时认识你.我们会预测到这一切，然后在幼儿园的时候资助你。

- That would have been great.

-那就太好了

- So, you talk about, obviously, never quitting, but do you think there are reasons to quit?

-所以，很明显，你说的是永远不会辞职，但你认为有理由辞职吗？

-I guess I quit, kind of, on my first startup, and on one of the iterations of Gobble, and the only reasons I have ever quit is because I think what I was doing didn't have enough impact in the broader world, or fulfillment for me, and meaning and purpose for me. I thought about this question, and those are the only reasons I have quit in the past. I think, though, that said, I think if the environment evolves, and you can't keep up with it, and things are just way surpassing you, then that would be a really hard look in the mirror, and I would may need to quit in that instance. So, not getting comfortable, and constantly iterating, and being not dogmatic is important. A good example of that is Netflix. Netflix evolved to stay alive. There are a lot of big titans of industry that fell along the way because they couldn't evolve.

-我想我在第一次创业的时候就辞职了，在Gobble的迭代中，我辞职的唯一原因是因为我认为我所做的对更广阔的世界没有足够的影响，或者对我的成就没有足够的影响，也没有对我有意义和目的。我想过这个问题，这是我过去辞职的唯一原因。我认为，尽管如此，我认为，如果环境在发展，而你跟不上它，而事情只是超越你，那么这将是一个非常艰难的照镜子，在这种情况下，我可能需要退出。因此，不舒服，不断迭代，不教条主义是很重要的。Netflix就是一个很好的例子。Netflix为了生存而进化。有很多工业巨头因为无法进化而衰落。

- So, two more questions, and then we'll take questions from the audience. One is, when you look back, are there decisions that you made in the early days that you're thankful that you made, that were really critical to your success, and if so, what were they?

-那么，再问两个问题，然后我们会接受观众的提问。一个是，当你回首往事时，你在早期所做的决定是否对你的成功很重要，如果是的话，它们是什么？

- Well, I'll talk about two. So, one of them is... A lot changed when we hired our executive chef, Thomas Ricci, and it wasn't just... We hired a chef to make consistent food, and good food, and safe food in a kitchen. What we gained, though, was the ability to innovate in food, and what I have learned is, what I would suggest to an entrepreneur, is that real entrepreurship comes from diverse perspectives, and from innovating at the edge of different industries. It's really hard just to get 10 homogenous engineers in a room, and make something incredible. You have to have other experts in consumer, or food, or something, whatever else is in your industry, to really find those little insights. So, our success came from innovating in technology and personalization, but a lot from innovating in food, and doing that prep work, and sending these food packages in a way that no other company sends them. That's not trivial. So, making room for creativity in different areas of your business is important, and we didn't have that creativity when the suppliers were just contractor chefs. The second thing was, I have to thank Adora. She is way too humble. When I had no money, and I did YC, and I swallowed my pride, we were still doing that personalized dinner service, and somehow I got matched up with Adora, and we didn't even figure it out by demo day. We raised 200K on demo day. It was nothing, 'cause it wasn't the right timing. We hadn't figured it out, and that we had just hired our chef, maybe six weeks or four weeks before demo day. So, I started working with him, and innovating with him, and focusing on our future, and meeting with Adora at her office, and anyways, I came to her, and I told her about this meal-kit idea, this 15-minute prep kit, back in 2014, and she was just so scary to me, and really badass, and really aggressive, and she was like, "Ooshma," and she was like, "If this is it, "you need to fucking do it," and she was like, "You need to do it now," and I was like, Okay, and she was like, "How fast can you do it?" and you kinda wanna impress people, so I'm like, I don't know, like two weeks, and she was like, "Great," and she was like, and so, I mean, she basically was like, she was like, she was like, it was, we had four weeks, so she was just like, it was in July, and I remember because it was August 1st, and she's like, "Do it by August 1st," and I was like, Okay, great, and I don't even know if she remembers all of that, but that's what I thought of every single day for 30 days, and I shut down that personalized dinner service, and we were doing, maybe, like one and a half to two million in ARR, but it wasn't going anywhere, and the food wasn't different enough, and when we had tested and R and D'ed these prep kits, where people cook it themselves, and feel like a superhero, that was magical in our testing and our customer visits. So, within 30 days, we just ripped the Band-Aid off, shut down that business. It was the highest revenue-making iteration that we had ever built. With every iteration we made more revenue, ultimately, even though we shut it down, and then, on August 3rd, we launched this thing, and I emailed Adora this long email of, here are the screenshots, here's this, and I was using her to hold myself accountable, and I was like, it's launched, and that was the best decision of our lives, and so just speed to execute, and the other lesson is finding people who are in your corner. You need people who are in your corner, and it's okay to not talk to the ones who aren't, but finding people who are in your corner, who you can use as an inspiration to motivate you, is really critical for speed.

-好吧，我来谈谈两件事.其中之一就是.。当我们雇了我们的行政主厨托马斯·里奇的时候发生了很大的变化，这不仅仅是.我们雇了一位厨师来做稳定的食物，好的食物，以及厨房里安全的食物。然而，我们获得的是食品创新的能力，我学到的是，我要向企业家建议的是，真正的创业来自于不同的视角，以及在不同行业边缘的创新。很难让10个同质的工程师在一个房间里做一些令人难以置信的事情。你必须有其他的专家在消费者，或食品，或其他什么，无论是在你的行业，真正找到这些小洞察力。因此，我们的成功来自于技术创新和个性化，但很大程度上来自于食品的创新，做好准备工作，并以其他公司没有发送的方式发送这些食品包。这可不是小事一桩。因此，在你业务的不同领域为创造力留出空间是很重要的，而当供应商只是承包商厨师的时候，我们就没有这种创造力了。第二件事是，我要感谢阿多拉。她太谦虚了。当我没有钱的时候，我做了YC，我吞下了我的骄傲，我们仍然在做那种个性化的晚餐服务，不知怎么的，我和Adora成了一对，我们甚至没有在演示的一天找到它。我们在演示日提高了200 K。没什么，因为时机不对。我们还没有搞清楚，我们刚刚雇了厨师，大概在演示前六周或四周。所以，我开始和他一起工作，和他一起创新，专注于我们的未来，在她的办公室和阿多拉会面，无论如何，我来到她身边，我告诉她这个饭盒的想法，这个15分钟的预备包，早在2014年，她对我来说太可怕了，真的很坏，很有进取心，她就像，“奥希玛”，她说，“如果这是这样的话。”她说，“你得他妈的去做”，“你现在就得做”，我说，“好吧，她说，”你能做多快？“你想给人留下深刻的印象，所以我觉得，我不知道，大概两个星期，她说，“很好”，她说，所以，我的意思是，她基本上就像，我们有四个星期，所以她就像，在七月，我记得因为那是8月1日，她说，“到8月1日，“我说，好吧，太好了，我甚至不知道她是否记得所有这些，但这是我每天都想到的30天，我关闭了个性化的晚餐服务，我们可能正在做，也许，像150万到200万arr，但它没有去任何地方，食物是不够的，当我们做了测试和测试。R和D编写了这些准备工具包，在那里人们自己做饭，感觉就像一个超级英雄，这在我们的测试和客户访问中都是神奇的。所以，在30天内，我们刚刚撕毁了创可贴，关闭了那家公司。这是我们有史以来创造收入最高的一次迭代。随着每一次迭代，我们最终获得了更多的收入，尽管我们关闭了它，然后，在8月3日，我们推出了这个东西，我给Adora发了一封长长的电子邮件，这是截图，这是这个，我用她来问我自己，我觉得，它已经启动了，这是我们生命中最好的决定，所以执行速度，还有其他的。教训是找到在你身边的人。你需要那些站在你身边的人，不和那些不在你身边的人说话是没问题的，但是找到那些在你身边的人，你可以用他们来激励你，这对速度来说是非常重要的。

- Cool, yeah, one of the things I tell people, just do it already. Do it.

-酷，是的，我告诉人们的一件事，已经做了去做吧。

- Yes. Exactly.

-是的。一点儿没错

- You have the idea. Stop, just stop middling. Just do it. Okay, so last question from me is, 50 to 100 years from now, Gobble is gonna be even bigger it is today, but what do you think it's gonna be?

-你有主意停，停下来。就这么做好吧，我的最后一个问题是，50到100年后，Gobble会变得更大，但你认为它会是什么呢？

- Wow, I... You know, in the 50 to 100-year vision, I actually want Gobble to be, let's call it the Disney of the home, and my thing with Gobble is about creating magical experiences at home that are easy and fit into this busy life, for any kind of person, single parents, hourly working, affluent people. I think that with all this technology, and all this fast food, we've over-instrumented a lot of industries, and I was missing that connection, and I think at the end of the day, when our lives are over, all we care about are the moments with our loved ones, and so if I can facilitate some of that, whether it's with learning, whether it's with dinner or food, and I'll keep evolving with the environment, I think that's a worthy cause.

哇我.你知道，在50到100年的愿景中，我真的想让Gobble成为，让我们称之为“家的迪斯尼”，而我与Gobble的关系就是在家里创造一种神奇的体验，这些体验对于任何类型的人、单亲父母、每小时工作的富人来说，都是一种轻松而又适合的生活体验。我认为，有了这么多的技术和所有的快餐，我们已经在许多行业中过度使用仪器，而我错过了这种联系，我认为在一天结束的时候，当我们的生命结束时，我们所关心的只是与我们所爱的人在一起的时刻，所以如果我能促进其中的一些事情，无论是学习，还是晚餐还是食物，我都会关心的。随着环境的发展，我认为这是一个有价值的事业。

- It's interesting. So, it's gonna be more than just food.

-很有趣所以，这不仅仅是食物。

- Yeah, we're working

-是的，我们在工作

- To my home.

-回我家

- on a few other things around education, and learning, and things like that.

-关于教育和学习的其他一些事情，以及诸如此类的事情。

- Awesome, cool. All right, so who has questions?

-太棒了，太酷了.好吧，那么谁有问题？

- [Audience Member] This question is both you guys. You talk about grit and determination, right? But besides that, you mentioned problems like people who are living here, have customers here, but are on, let's say, working visa, H-1B, stuff like that, right? They eventually rounded that legal hurdle, like you see them making progress, and they've clearly made progress, but now they're like, I don't know, what do I do with grit? Because I'm running into that problem, right? So, what kind of suggestion do you have for those people that are in that situation, and now they're like, shit, I just can't do anything about it now. I don't know what to do.

-[观众]这个问题是你们两个你说的是勇气和决心，对吧？但除此之外，你还提到了一些问题，比如住在这里的人，这里有顾客，但是，比如说，工作签证，H-1B，诸如此类的东西，对吗？他们最终绕过了法律上的障碍，就像你看到他们在进步一样，他们显然已经取得了进步，但现在他们却想，我不知道，我该拿勇气怎么办？因为我遇到了那个问题，对吧？那么，你对那些处于这种情况下的人有什么样的建议，现在他们就像，妈的，我现在什么也做不了。该怎么办呢?

- Repeat the question.

-重复问题。

- Yeah, so I think the question is around that there are environmental constraints and legal constraints, with regards to immigration and H-1B, and things like that, that prevent people from being where they want to be with their customer, right?

-是的，所以我认为问题就在于，在移民和H-1B等方面存在着环境限制和法律限制，这些限制阻碍了人们与客户在一起，对吗？

- [Audience Member] They've already been there, and now what do they do now? Like they have to do it full-time. They've reached the stage.

-[观众]他们已经在那里了，现在他们在做什么呢？就像他们必须全职工作一样。他们已经到了舞台。

- If you have to do it full-time, but you have to live in another country, is that what you're asking?

-如果你必须全职工作，但你必须住在另一个国家，这就是你想要的吗？

- [Audience Member] You're already here. You have your customers here. There's no point in going back to where you came from.

-[观众]你已经到了这里有你的顾客。回到你的家乡是没有意义的。

- Oh yeah.

-哦，是的.

- [Audience Member] So, you are here. You made products on the side. The product is out, and you have your first customer, and now you've reached the point where you can't pull this thing off on the weekends or on the evenings. So, you have to do this full-time, but you can't. So, what do you do there? Grit and determination: what's the way out?

-[观众]那么，你来了。你在旁边做了产品。产品出来了，你有了你的第一位客户，现在你已经到了周末或晚上都做不到这件事的地步。所以，你必须全职做这件事，但你做不到。那么，你在那里做什么？勇气和决心：有什么出路？

- Hmm, well, I know one of my good friends had a similar problem, and these are very tactical things. They established some shell company, and then one of the investors was put on as a board member, and then that board member sponsored the sponsorship, but you're really the CEO of the company, and so there are, I think, first of all, getting that H-1B visa is insane, right? And we have people who can't get that visa, so Gobble actually has an engineering team in India and in South Africa, and we're just waiting for the visas, and some people have been waiting for 14 months, and they're still working for us remotely. So, in those situations, that's nuts, and now there's very few loopholes, but if you already are here, sometimes there's some things you can do. I think YC has helped with some of that stuff.

-嗯，我知道我的一个好朋友也有类似的问题，这些都是战术上的问题。他们成立了一些空壳公司，然后其中一个投资者被任命为董事会成员，然后那个董事会成员赞助了赞助，但你真的是公司的首席执行官，所以我认为，首先，获得H-1B签证是疯狂的，对吧？我们有些人得不到签证，所以Gobble实际上在印度和南非都有一个工程团队，我们只是在等待签证，有些人已经等了14个月了，他们还在远程为我们工作。因此，在这种情况下，这是疯狂的，现在几乎没有漏洞，但如果你已经在这里，有时你可以做一些事情。我觉得YC帮了一些忙。

- If you're making revenue, and you have an actual company going, there's ways to go about it. I would just talk with a lawyer.

-如果你是在赚钱，而且你有一家真正的公司在运营，那就有办法做到这一点。我只想和律师谈谈。

- Great.

-太好了。

- [Audience Member] Hi, thank you so much for coming and sharing with us. Talk a little bit about the pricing journey of Gobble. I have a very successful offline business that I'm bringing online, and I'm scared, and I'm holding up because of pricing, so please inspire me and everyone else. Tell us about your pricing strategy for Gobble.

-(观众)嗨，非常感谢你能来和我们分享。谈谈Gobble的定价之旅。我有一个非常成功的线下业务，我带来了在线，我害怕，我坚持因为价格，所以请鼓励我和其他人。告诉我们你们对Gobble的定价策略。

- Yeah, interesting. So, we've done a lot.

是啊有意思所以我们做了很多。

- Repeat the question.

-重复问题。

- Oh yeah, sorry. Question is: tell us about the pricing strategy for Gobble, and how our pricing strategy evolved. Pricing is a big part of product-market fit, so it has to be priced appropriately for your market. Initially, we had different offerings at different prices on our marketplace. If you're in a scrappy company, the best tool for pricing experimentation is email, because it's hard to put different prices all over your website for different users. So, what I would do is email people, and I have a zillion things in beta all the time. So, I'd email our existing customers, and I'd say, hey, here's a beta on premium dinners, or here's a beta on value meals, or here's a beta on our wine program, and I would first do all the research of the market, and then send people, different clusters of people, three different prices, and in the early days I did it with like 20 people each, and then now I do it with like thousands of people each. So, in the early days it was a plain text email, and I would say, like, would you, and then sometimes to each individual person I would send three plans. I'd say, do you want plan A, B, or C? And so that, you can send different groups different sets of three plans, or you can send different groups different pricing for one product, but I would... You just, basically, you multiply the profit times how many people buy it, and whichever one wins in most profit is your best price.

哦是的抱歉问题是：告诉我们Gobble的定价策略，以及我们的定价策略是如何演变的。定价是产品市场适宜性的一个重要部分，所以它必须为你的市场定价。最初，我们在市场上以不同的价格提供了不同的产品。如果你在一家竞争激烈的公司，最好的定价工具是电子邮件，因为很难在你的网站上为不同的用户提供不同的价格。所以，我要做的是给人们发电子邮件，我总是在测试中拥有无数的东西。所以，我会给我们现有的顾客发电子邮件，我会说，嘿，这是高级晚餐的测试版，或者是价值餐的测试版，或者是我们的葡萄酒计划的测试版，我会先做市场的所有调查，然后发送人，不同的人群，三种不同的价格，在最初的几天里，我每个人都做了20人，然后现在我和成千上万的人一起做。所以，在早期，这是一封纯文本电子邮件，我会说，就像，你会不会，有时我会给每个人发三个计划。我会说，你想要A，B还是C计划？所以，你可以发送不同的组，不同的三套计划，或者你可以发送不同的组对一个产品的不同的价格，但我会.你只是，基本上，你乘以利润乘以多少人购买它，谁赢了最多的利润是你最好的价格。

- [Audience Member] Thank you.

-[观众]谢谢。

- Right here.

-就在这儿

- [Audience Member] So, thank you for coming to talk to us today. YC is really pro having a cofounder, and you've done it on your own for a while, so can you talk about that?

-[观众]所以，谢谢你今天来跟我们讲话。YC真的很专业有一个联合创始人，你已经自己做了很长一段时间了，所以你能谈谈这个吗？

- The question is that YC is very pro having a cofounder, and that I did it on my own for a while, can I talk about that? Hmm, when I started Gobble, I looked for a cofounder, and I kinda just started it, like I found chefs on Craigslist, and I was delivering food in my car, but I was dating cofounders, that are now other YC founders, at the time, and no one at that time, in that three, four-month period was willing to quit their job and join me, or was randomly as passionate about my idea as I was, so it was a unique, this was all very organic. I didn't really think I must have a cofounder, or I must be a solo cofounder. I tried to find one, and my priority was leaping on this idea, and so I didn't find one, and I just went with it. Long term, I think it is hard, very hard, as a single founder. Right now, our exec team operates kind of like as a hive mind, and I share everything with them. So, after many, many years, now we have like a five-person super-team that's all very invested, and kind of like a cofounding team, but at scale. In the early days, what I say for single founders is, you kind of have, like if you're swimming in the ocean, it's kind of like a net/buoy system. So, you have to find like three or six people that are like those orange buoys, and you're swimming by yourself, and you're super-super-tired, and when you wanna rest, you swim over to one of the buoys, and you hug it, and you talk to them, and they help you, but then, since you don't have a cofounder, no one can be your rock, right? So, next time you need to rest, you swim over to another buoy, and you hug that, and you kinda like, you basically crowdsource your cofounder from other founders and friends, and you have to really find, and in fact, some of my closest friends were other single founders, and so I had a group of like two or three single founders, and we all would constantly meet up for coffee or drinks after work, and trade stories, and help each other.

-问题是，YC非常支持有一个联合创始人，而且我自己做了一段时间，我能谈谈这个吗？嗯，当我创办Gobble的时候，我找了一个联合创始人，我就开始了，就像我在Craigslist上找到了厨师一样，我在车里送食物，但是当时我和其他的yc创始人约会，那个时候没有人愿意辞职，加入我，或者和我一样的热情。我的想法，所以这是一个独特的，这都是非常有机的。我不是真的认为我必须有一个共同创始人，或者我必须是一个单独的联合创始人。我试图找到一个，而我的首要任务是跳过这个想法，所以我没有找到一个，于是我就跟着做了。长期来看，我认为这是很难，作为一个单一的创始人。现在，我们的高管团队就像蜂巢一样运作，我和他们分享一切。所以，很多年后，现在我们有了一个五人的超级团队，这是非常投入的，有点像一个共同创建的团队，但规模很大。在早期，我对单身创始人说的是，你有点像，如果你在海里游泳，它就像是一个网/浮标系统。所以，你必须找到像橙色浮标那样的三六个人，你一个人游泳，你太累了，当你想休息的时候，你游到其中一个浮标边，拥抱它，和他们交谈，他们帮助你，但是，既然你没有联合创始人，没有人能成为你的岩石，对吗？所以，下一次你需要休息的时候，你游到另一个浮标，拥抱它，你会把你的联合创始人从其他的创始人和朋友中挤出来，你必须找到，事实上，我的一些最亲密的朋友是其他的单身创始人，所以我有一群大约两三名单身创始人，我们都会经常碰面。下班后喝咖啡或饮料，交换故事，互相帮助。

- Yes, right here.

是的就在这里

- [Audience Member] How has your life changed as we see you now, versus when you started? What were the lows? What were the highs?

-[观众]当我们现在看到你和你开始的时候相比，你的生活发生了怎样的变化？低点是多少？高点是多少？

- Wow.

-哇

- Here, I'll--

-这里，我会-

- Please, I apologize.

求你了我道歉

- So, the question is, how has your role as CEO changed from beginning to what it is now? Must have been dramatic.

-那么，问题是，你作为首席执行官的角色是如何从一开始就转变到现在的呢？一定是戏剧性的。

- Yes. Okay, in the beginning, one of the highs is just that you're constantly innovating. That 24/7 maker time is very precious to me. By contrast, now my day is like full of meetings. It's like meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings, and then dinners, and so yesterday I get home at like 11:00 p.m., today we're staring at 8:00 a.m., and it's really full, and I have to fight for strategic time, and maker time, and we still need that to keep evolving, right? So, I cherish that part of the early days. Obviously, the lows are are when nobody cares about you. You barely have any customers. I'm just sleeping at our office, or laying on our couch, and I remembered in some of the lows, I just would put white paper all over, and I'd lay on the floor, and I'd just be like a blank slate, and I'd be like, okay, what's next? Come up with it. And so, those are the lows. The highs, now, are, it's really gratifying when people start to know you, and every time I meet a customer in the wild it makes my day, and when I get too far from the customer, I actually notice myself getting unhappy again. I think, if you care about the customer and that experience long-term, all the money will come.

-是的。好吧，在开始的时候，其中之一就是你在不断创新。那个24小时的时间对我来说是非常宝贵的。相比之下，现在我的一天就像充满了会议。就像开会，然后是晚餐，所以昨天晚上11点我回家，今天我们在早上8点开始，它真的很满，我必须为战略时间，和创造时间而战，而我们仍然需要它来不断的进化，对吗？。所以，我珍惜早期的那段时光。很明显，当没有人关心你的时候才是低谷。你几乎没有顾客。我只是睡在我们的办公室，或者躺在沙发上，我想起来了，我会把白纸放在地上，然后躺在地板上，我就像一块白板，然后我会想，好吧，接下来怎么办？想出办法。所以，这些都是低谷。现在，当人们开始了解你的时候，我感到非常高兴，每次我在野外遇到一个顾客，都会让我感到高兴，当我离顾客太远的时候，我实际上又发现自己变得不开心了。我认为，如果你关心客户和长期的经验，所有的钱都会到来。

- Okay, let's take two more questions. One in the back.

-好吧，我们再问两个问题.后面有一个。

- [Audience Member] Yeah hi, my name is Shiraz, I'm the cofounder of Indiria, and one of my question is that in early stages you have to work with a lot of people, and how do you work with those people so that you have your sales, where you're getting the money from, but you also have people that work with you, and help your company grow? So, my question is, how do you get that happening without pestering them, like, hey,, hey,, but how do you do that in a good manner, and make them believe in your vision and work?

-(观众成员)嗨，我的名字是Shiraz，我是Indiria的联合创始人，我的问题之一是，在早期阶段，你必须和很多人一起工作，你是如何与这些人一起工作的，这样你才能得到你的销售，从哪里得到钱，但是你也有和你一起工作的人，帮助你的公司成长？所以，我的问题是，你是如何在不纠缠他们的情况下做到这一点的，比如，嘿，但是你是怎么做到的，让他们相信你的远见和工作呢？

- Yeah, that's great question. The question is, in the early days, you have I think the question is this: that you have your team that you're working with, and your customers, but there are other people that aren't on your team, that help you, and they're like mentors, advisors, friends. How do you get those people to work with you, without feeling like a pest, or that you're pestering them? I had a lot of this, so this is a really good question. Two things. One, I targeted the right advisors to help me, and I would find out where they were speaking, and I would wait till everybody was done talking to them, and be the last one to talk to the speaker, because they would remember me, and then I would walk them to their car, because they were in a rush. So, again, this is about psychology, and what does a speaker need to do? They've talked to 100 people. They need to go. If you carry their bags to their car, you're helping them, in a small, little way, and you're showing kind of some respect there. That's how I found Aaron Patzer from Mint.com back in the day, who was one of my early advisors, and some other people. That was a hack to finding the right mentors, find out where they are, and wait, and then follow up. The other thing is, I only asked people questions that was in their wheelhouse. So, I learned a lot about, what should I ask this person? Because when you spend time with someone who's like a mentor, and let's say you ask me about enterprise sales. I don't know anything about I know a little bit, but I don't know a lot about enterprise sales, and so it's kind of, it makes them feel bad, and it's also a waste of your time, and what I would do with people is I would bring I structured like a white piece of paper in three kind of thirds, I guess, and the top would be my progress, like what have I done since I last saw you? The next third would be, what am I working on now? And the last third would be, what are my challenges? And I was very organized about, all the time, that I asked from people, and so they always saw progress, and then they would see their advice come back, and I would save all my notes. So, in the early days, I met Reid Hoffman, and there was this cafe called University Cafe, and I went to cafes that only had paper tablecloths, and we would write all over the tablecloth, and then I would like take, it had coffee stains on it and stuff, and I would take it home, and I still have this box of those tablecloths that are like big butcher papers from like five, six years ago. So, it's just like, I think about all those little things, and about making time useful, taking notes, being prepared, and meeting with the right people.

-是啊，这是个好问题.问题是，在早期，我认为问题是：你有你的团队，你的客户，但是有其他人不是你的团队，帮助你，他们就像导师，顾问，朋友。你怎样才能让那些人和你一起工作，而不觉得自己是个讨厌鬼，或者你在缠着他们？我有很多这样的问题，所以这是一个很好的问题。两件事。第一，我找了合适的顾问来帮助我，我会找出他们在哪里发言，我会等到每个人都跟他们谈完之后，成为最后一个和演讲者交谈的人，因为他们会记得我，然后我会陪他们走到他们的车前，因为他们很忙。所以，再一次，这是关于心理学的，一个演讲者需要做什么？他们已经和100个人谈过了。他们得走了。如果你把他们的包搬到他们的车里，你就是在帮他们，用一种很小的方式，你在那里表现出了一些尊重。这就是我当年从Mint.com找到艾伦·帕泽(Aaron Patzer)的原因，他是我早期的顾问之一，还有其他一些人。这是一个黑客，找到合适的导师，找出他们在哪里，然后等待，然后跟进。另一件事是，我只问人们在他们的操纵。所以，我学到了很多，我应该问这个人什么？因为当你和一个像导师一样的人在一起的时候，比如说你问我关于企业销售的事情。我对我一点也不了解，但我对企业销售不太了解，所以这让他们感觉很糟糕，这也是对你时间的浪费，我想我会把我的结构安排得像一张白纸一样，我想，最重要的是我的进步，就像上次见到你之后我做了什么？接下来的三分之一是，我现在做什么？最后三分之一是，我的挑战是什么？我一直都很有条理，我问别人，所以他们总是看到进步，然后他们会看到他们的建议回来，我会保存我所有的笔记。所以，在早期，我遇到了里德·霍夫曼(Reid Hoffman)，有一家名为“大学咖啡厅”(University Cafe)的咖啡馆，我去了一家只有纸巾桌布的咖啡馆，我们会在桌布上到处写，然后我想要拍，上面有咖啡污渍之类的东西，我会把它带回家，我还有一盒桌布，就像五六年前的大屠夫纸。所以，就像，我在想那些小事情，让时间有用，做笔记，做好准备，和合适的人见面。

- I think, also, and you mentioned this, but I just wanna pull it out is being very thoughtful with the questions you ask, and being very specific, instead of asking broad questions that could take hours to answer.

-我想，你也提到过，但我想说的是，对你提出的问题要考虑得很周到，而且要非常具体，而不是提出可能需要几个小时才能回答的广泛问题。

- Yes.

-是的。

- You're more likely to get an answer as a result. Okay, last question. Make it good. Guy in the back.

-结果你更有可能得到答案。好的，最后一个问题。把它做好。后面那个家伙。

- [Audience Member] Hi, my name is Mark Rafael. In fact, I was so eager to hear you today, I left my exhibitionto come here.

-(观众)嗨，我叫马克·拉斐尔事实上，我今天很想听你的话，我离开展览来到这里。

- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

-天啊，太感谢你了.

- [Audience Member] Question is about investors. Actually, you said that you struggled a lot to get investment at the very beginning. You gave us some hacks, how you get customers. You simply don't get mentors What do you do? Did you develop some strategy over time to get good investors?

-[听众]问题是关于投资者的。实际上，你说你在一开始就为获得投资付出了很大的努力。你给了我们一些黑客，你是如何得到顾客的。你根本找不到导师你是做什么的？随着时间的推移，你是否制定了一些策略来吸引好的投资者？

- Wow, great question. The question is, we talked about hacks with getting customers, and what are the hacks around getting investors, 'cause I struggled with getting investors in the early days. I think, as you observe all your friends, everybody has lucky kind of easier fund-raising rounds, and everyone has hard fund-raising rounds. So, even if someone has it easy right now, and you have it hard, it's okay. It might be hard for them later, and the stories are very up and down. How do you get investors? Wow, it's still tough. For example, even last year, for our series B, I had a very difficult time raising money. It all looks fantastic, and there's lots of news, and videos, but it took every ounce of my being. It was the hardest fund-raising, and it's because Amazon acquired Whole Foods, and everyone is afraid of Amazon, so they just thought Amazon's gonna do Gobble, and also because Blue Apron went public, and they don't have a lot of defensibility, and there's lots of companies that are repackaging groceries, so their stock price went down, and that meant that Gobble wasn't going to work. So, last year was really, really hard. What advice do I have? I think that... Oh, here's one good piece of advice: a lot of it is grit, and a lot of it is testing, and then watching what resonates with people, and perfecting your pitch, and it's weird to practice in front of friends, but you should really, really do it, and have everyone help you with your deck and your pitch. That's important, but the one advice I have, and this may not be true for everyone, but some founders that are shyer, or not as confident, when they get to their last slide, they say, even if, and they say, even if the world ends, I will still get you your money back, and investors do not care about getting their money back. That is not sexy to them. You shouldn't say that. Founders are kind of like hedging against themselves, and saying, don't worry, I'll still protect your money, but you need to up-level that when you go talk to investors, and not say, even, if you need to say, you need to say that, we have the potential to be the next big X. We have the potential to be a $10 billion business in three years, and pump yourself up, stretch, power pose, but you have to end on that really big high note, very strong, and that's my piece of advice.

-哇，问得好.问题是，我们谈论的是如何招揽客户，以及吸引投资者的问题是什么，因为我在早期很难找到投资者。我认为，当你观察你所有的朋友，每个人都有幸运的更容易的筹资回合，而每个人都有艰难的筹资回合。所以，即使有人现在很容易，而你却很难，那也没关系。这对他们以后可能是很难的，故事是非常上下的。你是如何吸引投资者的？哇，还是挺难的。例如，即使在去年，我们的B系列，我有一个非常困难的时间筹集资金。这一切看起来都很棒，有很多的新闻和视频，但它消耗了我的每一分生命。这是最难筹集资金的，这是因为亚马逊收购了全食，每个人都害怕亚马逊，所以他们只是认为亚马逊会做Gobble，也因为Blue Apron上市了，他们没有太多的防御能力，还有很多公司正在重新包装杂货，所以他们的股价下跌了，这意味着Gobble无法运作。所以，去年真的很艰难。我有什么建议？我觉得.。哦，这里有一个很好的建议：很多都是坚韧的，很多是测试的，然后观察人们的共鸣，完善你的音高，在朋友面前练习是很奇怪的，但你真的应该，真的，让每个人都帮你做你的甲板和你的投球。这很重要，但我有一个建议，这可能不是每个人都能做到的，但有些创始人在他们最后一次走下坡路的时候比较羞怯，或者不那么自信，他们说，即使世界末日结束，我还是会把你的钱拿回来，投资者也不在乎要回他们的钱。对他们来说不性感。你不该这么说。创始人有点像对冲自己，说，别担心，我仍然会保护你的钱，但是你需要提高你的水平，当你去和投资者交谈时，不要说，即使你需要说，我们有潜力成为下一个大X。我们有潜力在三年内成为一家100亿美元的企业，然后振作起来，伸展，有力量的姿势，但你必须以很大的高音结束，非常强烈，这是我的建议。

- All right, thank you so much, Ooshma.

-好吧，非常感谢你，Ooshma

- Thank you.


-谢谢
