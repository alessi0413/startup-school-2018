# A Conversation with Elizabeth Iorns: Advice for Biotech Founders

- All right guys, we're gonna get started. Sorry for being late. I have up here Elizabeth Iorns. Is it Dr. Elizabeth Iorns, or Professor Elizabeth Iorns? Elizabeth is a cancer biologist by training. You got your PhD in cancer biology from the University of London, and you did your postdoc and then became an assistant professor, which you're still at, at University of Miami, School of Medicine. Got this correct?

-好了，伙计们，我们要开始了.抱歉来迟了。伊丽莎白·艾恩斯在上面。是伊丽莎白·奥恩斯博士还是伊丽莎白·奥恩斯教授？伊丽莎白是一名经过训练的癌症生物学家。你在伦敦大学获得了癌症生物学博士学位，你做了博士后，然后成为了一名助理教授，你现在还在迈阿密大学医学院。这是对的吗？

- Yes.

-是的。

- Cool. In 2011, she started Science Exchange, then called, theBench, which was an online market place for outsourcing science experiments. And she was part of the Y Combinator summer 2011 batch. And I think you might have been like the very first biotechy type company in YC, right? That's where we started. We started with you. And she's also the chairman of Reformer Therapeutics which just went through YC as well, last batch. She's also a part-time partner at YC, which means, in her free time, she helps all our biotech companies, which, at this point, it's like hundreds. I don't know what the exact number is, but hundreds of biotech companies. Today I wanna spend time talking about two things in particular. One is running a marketplace company, since that's what Science Exchange is. And two is, getting your perspective as someone who's now advised hundreds of biotech companies, what you think about what's going on in the space and, in particular, because I think there's an increase in slope of scientists coming into the field. So that'd be cool to talk about. To get started, you're, like I said, you're a cancer biologist by training. You were, I believe, doing breast cancer research right after college, I guess. How did you even, I mean, you were kind of going down the academic route, how did you even come upon startups? Where did that idea even come from?

-酷2011年，她创办了“科学交流”(Science Exchange)，后来被称为“TheBench”，这是一个外包科学实验的在线市场。她也是2011年夏季Y组合公司的一员。我认为你可能是YC第一家生物技术型公司，对吧？这就是我们开始的地方。我们从你开始。她也是“改革者治疗学”的主席，该公司刚刚通过了YC，最后一批。她也是yc的兼职合伙人，这意味着，在她的空闲时间里，她帮助了我们所有的生物技术公司，在这一点上，它就像数百家。我不知道确切的数字是多少，但是有几百家生物技术公司。今天我想花些时间特别谈两件事。一个是经营一家市场公司，因为科学交流就是这样的。第二个问题是，作为一个为数百家生物技术公司提供咨询意见的人，你对太空中正在发生的事情有何看法，尤其是因为我认为进入这一领域的科学家人数有所增加。所以谈论这件事会很酷的。首先，就像我说的，你是一名癌症生物学家。我想你大学毕业后就在做乳腺癌研究。你是怎么，我是说，你是怎么走上学术路线的，你是怎么开始创业的？这个主意是从哪里来的？

-Yeah, it was kind of random, especially to start a technology company like Science Exchange, rather than a biotech. I was actually, so I guess, taking Y Combinator's advice without knowing about Y Combinator's advice, to solve your own problem. I was looking at the way that scientific research was evolving and it was becoming much more specialized, much more multi-disciplinary. You had to form all these collaborations with other labs in order to access all of the latest technologies and I experienced that myself and realized that it was incredibly inefficient. And so that process of how you find somebody to work with, how you evaluate the quality of their ability to do that specialized work, and then even just the infrastructure to actually work with them. So, in biotech and in scientific research, the actual ownership of the scientific results is very important. And so, just figuring out who is actually the owner of those results, who has the intellectual property, publications rights, all of those things, isis very difficult. And so, I was talking about this with my co-founder and we sort of looked at other examples of industries that has solved this similar problem. So we were looking at oDesk and Elance at the time which have now become Upwork. But that was really an example of, you could solve this with a marketplace of experts and that was the basis of Science Exchange and it's never really kind of evolved much more beyond that in terms of the fundamental goal of what the company wants to achieve.

-是的，这有点随机，尤其是像科学交流这样的科技公司，而不是生物技术公司。我实际上，所以我想，接受Y组合者的建议，而不知道Y组合者的建议，来解决你自己的问题。我看到的是科学研究的发展方式，它变得更加专业化，更多学科。为了获得所有的最新技术，你必须与其他实验室建立所有的合作关系，我自己也经历了这些，并意识到这是非常低效的。这就是你如何找到工作对象的过程，你如何评估他们完成专门工作的能力的质量，甚至仅仅是与他们一起工作的基础设施。因此，在生物技术和科学研究中，科学成果的实际所有权是非常重要的。所以，只要弄清楚谁是这些结果的拥有者，谁拥有知识产权，出版权，所有这些东西，ISIS就很难。所以，我和我的联合创始人讨论了这个问题，我们看了一些其他行业的例子，这些行业已经解决了类似的问题。因此，我们当时正在研究oDesk和Elance，它们现在已经成为Upwork。但这确实是一个例子，你可以用一个专家市场来解决这个问题，这是科学交流的基础，在公司想要实现的基本目标方面，从来没有比这更多的进化。

- Can you dive a little bit deeper there? So, before, if I wanted to do some research and run an experiment, basically what it sounds like is there's this big disorganized process of I need 10 different things. It's super fragmented where the stuff is. Maybe give an example of, related to the research you were doing, of how it was so disorganized and then how Science Exchange now collapses all that into one place.

-你能跳得再深一点吗？所以，在此之前，如果我想做一些研究并进行一个实验，听起来基本上是有一个很大的混乱过程，我需要10种不同的东西。东西所在的地方太零碎了。也许给出一个例子，与你所做的研究有关，它是如何被如此杂乱的组织，然后科学交流现在如何崩溃成一个地方。

- Definitely super disorganized. Lots of fragmentation, both in terms of who you work with but also how you find the information. And, in some cases, the information is actually not really available. At the time when I was working as a breast cancer researcher I was running multiple different types of experiments and one example was microarray analysis which is definitely showing my time away from the lab because that's a very old-school technique now. But, at the time, it was what we used to analyze gene expression profiling. And, we just didn't have the types of arrays that I wanted to use and so I was trying to use Google and asking my friends and asking my old lab, can we use your infrastructure and, it was just incredibly inefficient. Also, actually, the inefficiency drives a lot of inefficiency in pricing in the market. So that was something that was a big learning point for me at that time point was, you could actually create a company that had margin in that space because the market was so inefficient due to the lack of information. So, for example, I was seeing, literally, 10 times price differences for an equivalent experiment because people really just didn't have access to what should it actually cost. And we see that still on Science Exchange today is that when people go and look for multiple options and they actually don't have the barriers of being able to work with them, they see, very frequently, price differences that are quite extraordinary for the same results that could be generated.

-绝对是超级杂乱无章很多零碎的东西，无论是在你和谁一起工作的时候，还是在你如何找到信息方面。而且，在某些情况下，这些信息实际上是无法获得的。在我做乳腺癌研究人员的时候，我正在进行多种不同类型的实验，其中一个例子是微阵列分析，它明确地显示了我离开实验室的时间，因为这是一种非常古老的技术。但是，在当时，这是我们用来分析基因表达谱的方法。而且，我们只是没有我想要使用的数组类型，所以我试着使用谷歌，询问我的朋友，询问我以前的实验室，我们能不能使用你的基础设施，这是非常低效率的。而且，实际上，低效率导致了市场定价上的许多低效率。对我来说，这是一个很大的学习点，在那个时候，你可以创建一家在这个领域有利润的公司，因为由于缺乏信息，市场效率很低。所以，举个例子，我看到的是，10倍的价格差异，因为人们真的无法获得真正的价格。我们今天仍然在科学交流上看到，当人们去寻找多种选择时，他们实际上没有能够与他们合作的障碍，他们经常看到，价格差异对于可能产生的同样的结果来说是非常不寻常的。

- Got it. So just to take one step back, when you were an academic, I don't know if that's a bad word, but,

-明白了所以退一步，当你还是个学者的时候，我不知道这是不是个坏词，但是，

- Nope.

-没有。

- When you were an academic,

-你当学者的时候

- Maybe to some people.

-也许对某些人来说.

- was that a tough choice, to just make that switch? 'cause you spent so many years studying for this one thing and then you just are starting essentially what is a tech company that is not solving that one thing that you spent, up until that point, your entire life going after.

-这是一个艰难的选择吗？因为你花了这么多年的时间研究这件事，然后你就开始了一家高科技公司，它并没有解决你花在这一点上的一件事，直到那一刻，你的整个生命都在追求。

- Yeah, and actually, at the time, I didn't really have a lot of role models to sort of look to either. I was in Miami, which was not a very startup place. And now it's actually, it's interesting to see the evolution, not just in the biotech world but, just generally, in the startup ecosystem and all of the infrastructure that's been created. I think University of Miami even has now an incubator associated with the School of Medicine that helps people kinda create companies. I remember, at the time, having this idea for a company and I actually asked the university 'cause I was a little bit worried if I have this idea while I'm still working there, will they try to get some ownership stake from the idea? 'cause actually when you work in academia the results you generate don't belong to you. So I think that's kind of a common misperception that universities actually own your work. So it's often a challenge to spin those results out of the university. So I was kind of worried, well, if I have this idea, will they own it? So I went and talked to the tech transfer office and they were just like, whatever. Like, go do whatever you want. And, it was kind of interesting and they didn't really have any guidance on how to do that. But coincidentally, I read about Y Combinator in Wired Magazine. So there was actually a Wired Magazine interview all those years ago about Y Combinator and that was where I first learned about it and I was like, wow, that sounds super cool. Why don't we just like apply for it? And we were total outsiders. We didn't know anybody at Y Combinator. We didn't know anybody that had gone through Y Combinator. And we just applied with this idea and were fortunate enough to get in.

-是的，事实上，在那个时候，我也没有太多的榜样。我在迈阿密，那不是个创业的地方。现在，不仅是在生物技术领域，而且总体来说，在启动生态系统和所有已经创建的基础设施中，看到进化是很有趣的。我认为迈阿密大学现在甚至有一个与医学院有关的孵化器，帮助人们创建公司。我记得，当时，我有一个公司的想法，我问大学，因为我有点担心，如果我有这个想法，如果我还在那里工作，他们会试图从这个想法中获得一些所有权的股份吗？因为实际上，当你在学术界工作时，你所产生的结果并不属于你。所以我认为这是一种普遍的误解，即大学实际上拥有你的工作。因此，将这些结果从大学中剥离出来往往是一项挑战。所以我有点担心，嗯，如果我有这个想法，他们会拥有它吗？所以我去和技术转让办公室谈了谈，他们就像，随便什么。去做你想做的事。而且，这是一种有趣的，他们并没有真正的指导如何做到这一点。但巧合的是，我在“连线”杂志上读到了Y组合者的故事。事实上，多年前有一次“连线”杂志的采访是关于Y组合器的，那是我第一次了解它，我觉得，哇，听起来超级酷。为什么我们不喜欢申请呢？我们完全是局外人。我们在Y Combinator不认识任何人。我们不知道有谁经历过Y组合。我们只是应用了这一想法，很幸运地加入了这一行列。

- So you talk a little bit about tech transfer. I do think that a lot of people in academia who are thinking about starting a startup do think that is a huge issue. In some sense, there are, from some universities we've had to work with with some of our startups, it is a huge issue. Do you have any advice for them on how to navigate that process? Should that be the barrier in your mind?

-所以你说了一点关于技术转让的事.我确实认为，在学术界，很多想要创业的人都认为这是个大问题。从某种意义上说，从某些大学来看，我们不得不与一些初创企业合作，这是一个很大的问题。你对他们如何在这个过程中导航有什么建议吗？这应该是你脑海中的障碍吗？

- I do think it is an issue, particularly for scientific startups because if you're trying to spin out actual research that was done already and, I think people often ask me like, what's a good time to join Y Combinator if you're creating a science startup? And, actually, I do think a good time to join is once you've already generated a lot of the R&D from grant-funded work because you don't wanna spend years and all of this money trying to pursue a research hypothesis. You really wanna be in the development phase. And so, I think that gets very difficult with a lot of the universities. I think some of them are trying to be more sort of founder-friendly and create ways to more readily license the results that were generated, but it's still a significant obstacle.

-我确实认为这是一个问题，特别是对于科学初创企业来说，因为如果你试图把已经做过的实际研究分解出来，我想人们经常问我，如果你创建一家科学创业公司，什么时候可以加入Y Combinator？而且，事实上，我认为加入的好时机是，一旦你已经从赠款资助的工作中产生了很多研发成果，因为你不想花很多年和所有这些钱去追求一个研究假设。你真的想进入发展阶段。所以，我认为很多大学都很难做到这一点。我认为他们中的一些人试图变得对创始人更友好，并创造出更容易获得所产生结果的许可的方法，但这仍然是一个很大的障碍。

- Do you see that academics, is a trend they're moving more into startups or, what do you see, or, maybe, we just get the bubble view here in San Francisco, but, that's our only thing I see anecdotally, but do you think that's a growing trend overall?

-你看到了吗，学者们，他们更倾向于创业，或者，你看到了什么，或者，也许，我们只是在旧金山看到了泡沫，但是，这是我唯一看到的事情，但你认为总体上这是一个不断增长的趋势吗？

- Yeah, I think people are more willing to just create companies I think generally. I think that's sort of a macro trend way beyond science is, really just entrepreneurship has become this viable career path and people are like, oh yeah, I could create a company. And it's just become a lot easier. The infrastructure that's been created through Y Combinator but also through things like Stripe and things like AWS has made it so much easier for people to create companies and I think in the science space, we're starting to see that. So, obviously, Science Exchange is one way to do that but, there's some really interesting other evolutions like LabCentral and other lab space, QB3, that provide lab space by the bench that's very cost-effective and you can just rent one bench per month and be able to get started really cost-effectively. So those things are lowering the barriers to entry. And so I think academics, what I would like to see more of is, how can we allow the true, I would say, the analogy to what we've seen in the engineering world, the software engineering world, is that the actual developers, the software developers, become the entrepreneurs. And they maintain that and really build this company around them. I think that's still very difficult for scientists, particularly PhD and postdoc scientists. They actually make the discoveries in these labs. So they're the ones doing the work. To allow the time for them to actually be the ones to be the founder of the company is pretty challenging. And usually, what you'll see is, a well-established, famous PI, so a principal investigator, kind of being a co-founder of that company, but just to give it legitimacy and then, that usually allows people to bring in funding. But, I think that's also kind of sad. Like, why do we have to have these sort of figureheads who own large stakes of these companies in order for them to get off the ground and get started and I wanna see that change.

-是的，我认为人们更愿意仅仅创建我认为的公司。我认为这是一种超越科学的宏观趋势，真正的企业家精神已经成为一条可行的职业道路，人们就像，哦，是的，我可以创建一家公司。事情变得简单多了。通过Y Combinator创建的基础设施，以及诸如Stripe和AWS这样的东西，使得人们创建公司变得非常容易，我认为在科学领域，我们已经开始看到这一点。因此，很明显，科学交流是一种方法，但是，还有一些非常有趣的其他进化，比如LabCentral和其他实验室空间QB3，它通过工作台提供实验室空间，这是非常符合成本效益的，而且你可以每月租用一张板凳，这样才能真正以低成本的方式开始。所以这些东西降低了进入的门槛。所以我想，学者们，我更想看到的是，我们如何才能让真实的，我要说，类比于我们在工程界，软件工程界所看到的，是实际的开发人员，软件开发人员，成为企业家。他们坚持这样做，并以他们为中心建立了这家公司。我认为这对科学家来说仍然是非常困难的，尤其是博士和博士后科学家。他们实际上是在这些实验室里发现的。所以他们才是做这项工作的人。让他们真正成为公司创始人的时间是相当有挑战性的。通常情况下，你会看到的是，一位久负盛名的著名PI，所以是一位首席调查员，他是该公司的联合创始人，但只是为了让它具有合法性，然后，这通常允许人们引入资金。但是，我觉得这也有点可悲。比如，为什么我们要有这样的有名无实的人，他们拥有这些公司的大量股份，这样他们才能起步，开始工作，我想看到这种变化。

- Yeah, that's something we, as you know, talk a lot about to people who, when they apply, and then we see that kind of structure and then we try to go help them fix it, essentially.

-是的，正如你所知，这是我们经常和人们谈论的，当他们申请的时候，我们看到这种结构，然后我们试着去帮助他们修复它，本质上。

- Yeah

-是啊

- You don't wanna lose too much of your company too soon. All right, so, Science Exchange. You already described what problem you were trying to solve. And then you've decided, at this point, in 2011 to start the startup. How did you get your first users? And you have two sides of the marketplace so it's doubly hard for you. How did you approach both sides.

-你不会太早就失去公司的好吧，那么，科学交流。你已经描述过你想要解决的问题了。到目前为止，你已经决定在2011年开始创业。你是怎么得到你的第一批用户的？你有市场的两面，所以这对你来说是双重的困难。你是怎么接近双方的。

- I think marketplaces are really challenging because you don't control, really, the success of the business. I mean, you do, but you don't have, you're not just kind of building something and selling it. You have to then make sure you have the things to sell on the other side. So it is really challenging. I think when we first started, we were very MVP-like in our approach. So, I think, the first version of Science Exchange which, as you mentioned, was actually called The Bench, which was renamed during Y Combinator thanks to Paul Graham's very good advice about our poor naming choice. So, we kind of threw up this website and it was literally like, put your what you need on this website and then other people will see it and they will give you options, which is, even at the time, as a scientist, I was like, I wouldn't use this. It seemed like very quick to get something up and see who would test it out but it was obvious, right from the start, they would actually have to create a true marketplace and have supply that was visible and actually even more so with Science Exchange, what we had to do is create a curated marketplace that operates in the B2B sector. So, what we had to do was build QA, so quality assurance. We had to actually qualify and contract every provider that's available through the marketplace and then surface all of the results so that when somebody comes to the marketplace they can literally find what they need and they can give them the information that's required for them to be able to quote accurately because they already know there's confidentiality agreements in place. And then they actually also had to manage those projects 'cause these aren't just put it in your cart and check out. You have to actually manage a project with somebody who works in another part of the world from you. And so, all this had to be built into the software so that it was many iterations of learning about where really is the value that comes from what we are providing? And, I think marketplaces have evolved a lot from being predominantly consumer-focused. There's a lot of interesting B2B examples that are emerging and Science Exchange obviously sits very firmly in that category.

-我认为市场真的很有挑战性，因为你不能真正控制企业的成功。我是说，你知道，但你没有，你不仅仅是在建造和出售它。然后，你必须确保你有在另一边出售的东西。所以这真的很有挑战性。我想当我们第一次开始的时候，我们是非常的MVP-就像我们的方法一样。所以，我认为，第一个版本的科学交流，正如你提到的，实际上被称为长凳，它被重新命名在Y组合期间，感谢保罗格雷厄姆对我们糟糕的命名选择的非常好的建议。所以，我们会把你需要的东西放在这个网站上，然后其他人会看到，他们会给你选择，即使是在那个时候，作为一个科学家，我想，我不会用这个。似乎很快就能找到一些东西，看看谁会测试出来，但很明显，从一开始，他们就必须创建一个真正的市场，并拥有可见的供应-更重要的是，通过科学交流-我们要做的就是创建一个在B2B部门运作的策划市场。所以，我们要做的是建立质量保证，所以质量保证。我们必须对通过市场提供的每一家供应商进行资格认证和合同，然后公开所有的结果，这样当有人来到市场时，他们就可以真正地找到他们需要的东西，他们可以给他们所需要的信息，以便他们能够准确地报价，因为他们已经知道已经有保密协议了。然后他们实际上也必须管理这些项目，因为这些项目不只是放在你的购物车和检查。你必须和你在世界另一个地方工作的人一起管理一个项目。因此，所有这些都必须内置到软件中，这样才能反复学习我们所提供的东西的真正价值所在？而且，我认为市场已经从以消费者为主发展了很多。有许多有趣的B2B例子正在出现，而科学交流显然是非常坚定地站在这一类别。

- And, what was more difficult, supply or demand?

-还有，更困难的是供应还是需求？

- Definitely demand, so, supply for us is and was pretty straightforward in the sense that providers are looking for work, providers of these services. It's a very fast-growing industry so also highly fragmented and they actually also suffer the same challenges that the demand size has. So, for them, if they wanna sell one of their projects, they actually have to go and contract with each client they work with, which can take several months. And they have to go through quality assurance and get set up. And so, for them, if they're on Science Exchange, now, all of a sudden, every one of our clients can work with them instantly. So that's a huge value proposition. It took us a lot longer to convince the large players in the market, so, the large CROs, that this would be something that they should be part of, but actually we have been able to do that as well. So, I think one of the important lessons that we learned quickly was for this to be a really effective solution, it had to be the platform that was used for everything at the companies that were using it. So, not just one-off come and shop on the marketplace but actually use it as system for managing all of the projects that are going on with the external partners. And, in order to do that, you truly do have to have all of the major players that they wanna work with on the platform. And I've seen other companies who have B2B marketplaces struggle a little bit where they haven't had the large established players on the supply side. And without that, I think it's very difficult to have an enterprise partnership that uses the platform.

-绝对的需求，所以，我们的供应是非常直截了当的，因为供应商正在寻找工作，这些服务的提供者。这是一个快速增长的行业，也是高度分散的行业，它们实际上也面临着与需求规模相同的挑战。因此，对于他们来说，如果他们想出售他们的一个项目，他们实际上必须去和他们工作的每一个客户签订合同，这可能需要几个月的时间。他们必须通过质量保证和建立。所以，对他们来说，如果他们在进行科学交流，现在，突然之间，我们的每一个客户都可以立即与他们合作。这是一个巨大的价值主张。我们花了很长时间才说服市场上的大公司，所以，大型的CRO们，相信这是他们应该参与的事情，但实际上我们也能做到这一点。所以，我认为我们很快学到的一个重要的教训是，这是一个非常有效的解决方案，它必须是一个平台，在所有使用它的公司中被使用。所以，不仅仅是一次地在市场上购物，而是把它作为管理与外部合作伙伴正在进行的所有项目的系统。而且，为了做到这一点，你真的必须有所有的主要参与者，他们想要在平台上工作。我也见过其他有B2B市场的公司遇到了一点困难，因为他们在供应方面还没有强大的老牌企业。没有这一点，我认为很难有一个使用该平台的企业伙伴关系。

- Do you remember the very first, on the demand side, the very first customer? What did they do?

-你还记得第一个，在需求方面，第一个客户吗？他们做了什么？

- Yeah, totally.

-是的，完全是.

-I remember, actually, so our first customers were totally my friends who were scientists who I would tell, if have experiments you're running you have to try out Science Exchange and they actually, it was great user feedback because, for them, it did turn out to be, this really high-touch, very concierge service, so they found great options that were really cost effective. So it wasn't like they just used it because we made them. But, I think, they taught us a enormous amount. But I also remember the first customer that ever was just not related to us. Just came onto the platform and used it and that was pretty exciting. We were actually in Italy at my brother's wedding and I was like, oh my God, somebody used our website! Yay.

-我记得，实际上，我们的第一批客户完全是我的朋友，我会告诉他们，如果你正在做实验，你必须尝试一下科学交流，实际上，这是很好的用户反馈，因为对他们来说，这的确是一项非常高触觉、非常礼宾的服务，所以他们找到了非常好的选择，这些选择非常符合成本效益。所以他们不是因为我们做的才用它的。但是，我想，他们教会了我们大量的东西。但我也记得第一位与我们没有关系的客户。刚上了站台，用了它，这是相当令人兴奋的。我们在意大利参加我哥哥的婚礼，我说，天哪，有人用了我们的网站！耶。

- Stop the wedding, I need to check this out.

-停止婚礼，我要看看这个

- Totally.

-完全是。

- What was the experiment they were trying to run? Do you remember?

-他们试图运行的实验是什么？你还记得吗？

- It was microarray as well. Like, this was popular at that time.

-这也是微阵列。就像，这在当时很流行。

- Cool, so, we talk a lot about that sort of school product-market fit. For you, what was that? When did you know you had that and how did you define it and what metrics were you looking at?

-酷，所以，我们谈了很多关于这种学校产品-市场适合。对你来说，那是什么？你什么时候知道你有这种情况，你是如何定义它的，你看的是什么指标？

- For us, I think, we defined product-market fit when we had our first large pharmaceutical client actually use the platform for whole sectors of their business. So for us it was Amgen and they launched Science Exchange for all of their discovery research which was a really big deal for us at the time and we sort of realized, oh, we actually have something that they do a lot of steps manually at the moment and this product actually automates providing all the information about who they should work with, who is all of these new options for new types of technologies that they might be just exploring. And then, even actually their business intelligence around looking at spend and supply performance. Those things took us a while to kind of figure out where the core value props were.

-对我们来说，我认为，当我们的第一个大型制药客户真正将该平台用于整个行业时，我们就定义了产品市场的适合性。所以对我们来说，这是安进，他们为他们所有的发现研究发起了科学交流，这对我们来说是一件很重要的事情，我们意识到，哦，我们实际上有一些他们现在手动做的事情，这个产品实际上自动提供了关于他们应该和谁一起工作的所有信息，谁是这些新的。新技术的选择，他们可能只是在探索。然后，甚至他们的商业智慧围绕着消费和供应的表现。这些东西花了我们一段时间才弄清楚核心价值道具在哪里。

- You know you're on to something when a big company who spent many years and money trying to build that problem and solve that problem internally has all of sudden just shifted to your product and then starting to pay you for that. That's a big thing. Not just in biotech, but in general for lots of other things.

-你知道，当一家大公司花了很多年的时间和金钱试图解决这个问题，并在内部解决这个问题时，突然间你就转向了你的产品，然后开始为此付钱。这是件大事。不仅仅是在生物技术领域，而且在一般情况下也是如此。

- Yeah, I think much more so I think in software. It's really interesting because people always ask me today like, who are your main competitors and how do you kind of think about competitive differentiation and all that? And, still, to me, our main competitor is status quo, so that people still set up these really crazy SharePoint processes to manage their external vendors and I always go in there, I'm like, this is horrible. Why are you doing this? And, big companies, they just love SharePoint. They're like, oh yeah, my SharePoint site I have created all of these really Byzantine processes which only apply to my like five vendors I work with, and everyone else has to go through some other crazy process. And I'm like, okay, but you can just transition all of that onto this platform and, it's always this interesting kind of battle of trying to convince them that the software automates all that hard work is often actually one of our biggest challenges.

-是的，我想得更多-我在软件方面也是这样想的.这真的很有趣，因为今天人们总是问我，谁是你的主要竞争对手，你是如何看待竞争差异化的？而且，对我来说，我们的主要竞争对手是现状，所以人们仍然建立这些非常疯狂的SharePoint进程来管理他们的外部供应商，我总是去那里，我觉得，这太可怕了。你为什么要这么做？而且，大公司，他们只是喜欢SharePoint。他们就像，哦，是的，我的SharePoint网站，我创建了所有这些真正的拜占庭程序，它们只适用于我的五个供应商，其他所有人都要经历其他疯狂的过程。我想，好吧，但是你可以把所有这些都转移到这个平台上，这总是一场有趣的战斗，试图让他们相信，软件自动化了所有的努力工作，这通常是我们最大的挑战之一。

- So, one of the things I really love that you're doing, and announced a long time ago, was the Reproducibility Initiative. So the idea that, It seems obvious to do, which is, if you run an experiment and you publish results someone else should be able to reproduce it to validate that it's something done. And so can you talk a little bit about why you're doing that, what you're doing and why has this never been done? Has it just been a money problem, or is it something that only Science Exchange actually can do because you have the process in place?

-所以，我最喜欢你做的事情之一，很久以前就宣布了，那就是可复制性计划。这个想法似乎很明显，也就是说，如果你做了一个实验，并且发布了结果，其他人应该能够复制它，来验证它是否已经完成。你能谈谈你为什么要这样做，你在做什么，为什么从来没有这样做过？这是一个资金问题，还是只有科学交流才能做到，因为你已经准备好了？

- The Reproducibility Initiative is, I still think it's a really cool project. It's still very controversial, even years later.

-可复制性倡议是，我仍然认为这是一个非常酷的项目。即使几年后，它仍然很有争议。

- Really!

-真的！

- Oh, yeah.

-哦，是的.

- Why is it controversial?

-为什么有争议？

- Oh my God. Still so controversial. It's controversial because of a lot of reasons. I think the main reason is that people are not sure of the value of it, which I think is legitimate. I think there's still a question of how efficient is it to replicate experiments and that was actually, when you say, is it Science Exchange was the only way we could do it, our hypothesis was that, yeah, having a network where people already had all of the right assays or the right infrastructure or the right animal model, would be the only way that it was actually practically possible to do it. Previously, obviously, people didn't have that. They had that same challenge of, oh, I have to go find somebody who has that same animal model or has that same instrument and then I have to convince them and contract them and all that kind of stuff. So, yeah, the Reproducibility Initiative actually is kind of Science Exchange's part of our mission to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research. And that project is quite broad. It covers both things like antibody validation, which we've done a lot of, so reagent validation, things like re-analysis of epidemiology results, so we worked with the Gates Foundation to do that, and then the projects that we're most well-known for which is actually replicating published results. And we do that both for the pharmaceutical industry, which is way easier and way less controversial because they just come and say, hey, I'm interested in this result and then we quickly find a facility that can replicate the key results and provide those back to them. However, the cancer biology reproducibility project and the Prostate Cancer Foundation project are the two ones that people have followed the most, which is public replications where we've actually published the replication studies. And, that's controversial because people don't generally do this. I think it goes against the cultural norm of really not publishing replication studies. I also think people are really afraid and they sort of mix up failed replication with things like fraud. People are really afraid that if the result is found to be non-reproducible, that that will have a negative impact on their career, which I think is probably true, but it shouldn't be. The reality is that the results that have been generated show that most published results are not reproducible. So, if that's true, then we should try to understand that and study it, which is my opinion as a scientist. We should study the science behind why is this the case rather than try to go after individual people and say like, oh, your science is horrible. Because, clearly, that's not the case. Clearly, it's that most things are not reproducible when they're published because of a variety of complex factors of which we've started to impact. But I think there's still a lot of work to do.

我的天啊还是很有争议。这是有争议的，因为有很多原因。我认为主要原因是人们不确定它的价值，我认为这是合法的。我认为还有一个问题，复制实验的效率有多高？当你说，这是我们唯一能做到的方法吗？我们的假设是，是的，有一个网络，人们已经有了正确的测试，正确的基础设施，或者正确的动物模型，这将是唯一的方法，它实际上是可能做到这一点。以前，很明显，人们没有这样的经历。他们也面临着同样的挑战，哦，我得去找一个拥有相同动物模型或者有同样工具的人，然后我就得说服他们，让他们接受合同，以及诸如此类的东西。所以，是的，可复制性倡议实际上是科学交流的一部分，我们的使命是提高科学研究的质量和效率。这个项目相当广泛。它涵盖了抗体验证，我们做了大量的试剂验证，像重新分析流行病学的结果，所以我们和盖茨基金会合作做了这件事，然后我们最著名的项目，实际上是复制已经发表的结果。我们这样做是为了制药业，这很容易，也不那么有争议，因为他们只是想说，嘿，我对这个结果很感兴趣，然后我们很快就找到了一个可以复制关键结果并提供给他们的设施。然而，癌症生物学可复制性项目和前列腺癌基金会项目是人们最关注的两个项目，这是公开复制，我们实际上已经发表了复制研究。而且，这是有争议的，因为人们通常不会这样做。我认为这违反了不发表复制研究的文化规范。我还认为人们真的很害怕，他们把失败的复制和欺诈之类的东西混为一谈。人们真的害怕如果结果被发现是不可复制的，那将对他们的职业生涯产生负面影响，我认为这可能是真的，但事实并非如此。事实是，已经产生的结果表明，大多数已发表的结果是不可复制的。所以，如果这是真的，那么我们应该试着去理解和研究它，这是我作为一名科学家的观点。我们应该研究为什么会这样的科学，而不是去找个别的人说，哦，你的科学太可怕了。因为，很明显，事实并非如此。很明显，大多数东西在出版时都是不可复制的，因为我们已经开始影响各种复杂的因素了。但我认为还有很多工作要做。

- What are the top two complex factors that--

-最复杂的两个因素是什么-

- So I think the main reason that I've seen things are not reproducible is the quality of assay validation. It's really interesting when you go and talk to pharmaceutical companies because they also transfer experiments. They replicate experiments in the sense that they'll set something up at their facility and then they'll outsource to a CRO to run their assay for them over and over again. They call it tech transfer or assay transfer and that process is incredibly efficient. They can do this very easily and it's got a high probability of working. And so, when you look at that, I don't think it's much different than if you take a published result and you try and re-run that assay in another lab. But the main difference is that, when you work in a pharmaceutical company, you have SOPs, you have everything documented, you look at assay variability, you look at positive and negative controls. There's just a lot more actual validation of the type, the actual experimental assay that's used before it's transferred. And that's very different than in academia. In academia, you tend to take, oh yeah, I've got this animal model in my lab, or I've got this cell line in my lab, I'm just gonna run this experiment. Hopefully you include positive and negative control, but maybe not, and you also don't look at things like variability of the assay, reproducibility of the assay. And I think a lot of what we see in published results is likely to be noise, rather than true experimental effects. And so, until we kind of understand that more, we will have an issue with reproducing those results.

因此，我认为我看到的东西不能被复制的主要原因是化验验证的质量。当你去和制药公司交谈的时候，这真的很有趣，因为他们也会进行实验。他们复制实验的意义是，他们将在他们的设施设置一些东西，然后他们将外包给一个CRO，为他们一次又一次地进行他们的检测。他们称其为技术转移或化验转移，这一过程非常有效。他们可以很容易地做到这一点，而且它有很高的工作概率。所以，当你看这个的时候，我认为这和你发表的结果没有太大的不同，你试着在另一个实验室里重新进行这个测试。但主要的区别是，当你在一家制药公司工作时，你有SOP，所有的东西都有记录，你观察化验的可变性，你看到的是正负对照。只是有更多的实际验证的类型，实际的实验分析，使用之前，它被转移。这和学术界完全不同。在学术界，你倾向于，哦，是的，我在我的实验室里有这个动物模型，或者我在我的实验室里有这个细胞系，我只是要做这个实验。希望你包括了阳性和阴性对照，但也许没有，你也不看分析的可变性，分析的重复性。我认为我们在发表的结果中看到的很多东西很可能是噪音，而不是真正的实验效果。因此，在我们进一步理解之前，我们在复制这些结果时会遇到问题。

- That's sort of scary.

-这有点吓人.

- I know.

-我知道。

- But, you're saving the world, so, save us from this problem. Going back to Science Exchange, what is the biggest challenge as a CEO of a marketplace company that you have today and how has that challenge morphed over time? What was the biggest challenge when you just started to what is the biggest challenge today?

-但是，你是在拯救世界，所以，把我们从这个问题中拯救出来.回到科学交流，作为一家市场公司的首席执行官，你今天面临的最大挑战是什么？随着时间的推移，这种挑战是如何演变的？当你刚开始的时候，最大的挑战是什么？今天最大的挑战是什么？

- Oh yeah, I'm sure like, so many challenges along the way. When we first started Science Exchange, the biggest challenge was, can we get anybody to use it? I think that was kind of the first challenge. And then, can we build something where the very conservative pharmaceutical industry will use it? And that was important for us because when you look at spend breakdown, the market is predominantly for outsourced-research focused in the pharmaceutical industry, so that they control over a hundred billion dollars of spend per year. So, if we couldn't get them to use the platform, we would have a lot of issue with really creating a truly large company. Today, I think our biggest issues are more around scaling. So, how do we, we're still only 85 people. We've just signed a couple of extremely large partnerships and so we're really trying to execute against some pretty tight deadlines with staff that are focused on just one of these large integrations. And so, trying to kind of make sure that we don't take on too much while also realizing there's enormous opportunity. We don't want to sort of overlook that. I think just staying focused, executing on the right things and being really disciplined about that, which is always really hard. When you have multiple opportunities that you can go after, I think that discipline is incredibly important.

-哦，是的，我敢肯定，在这过程中有很多挑战。当我们第一次开始科学交流的时候，最大的挑战是，我们能让任何人使用它吗？我认为这是第一个挑战。然后，我们能建造一些非常保守的制药业会使用它的东西吗？这对我们来说很重要，因为当你看支出细分的时候，市场主要是外包的-专注于制药业的研究，这样他们每年就能控制超过1000亿美元的支出。所以，如果我们不能让他们使用这个平台，我们就会对真正创建一家真正的大公司产生很大的争议。今天，我认为我们最大的问题是扩大规模。所以，我们还只有85个人。我们刚刚签署了几个非常大的合作伙伴关系，所以我们正试图在一些非常紧迫的最后期限前执行，而这些工作人员只专注于这些大型集成中的一个。所以，试着确保我们不要承担太多，同时也意识到有巨大的机会。我们不想忽视这一点。我认为只是集中精力，执行正确的事情，并在这方面受到严格的约束，这总是很难做到的。当你有多种机会，你可以追求，我认为纪律是难以置信的重要。

- Yeah, focus is really hard, especially, as you get more employees and you get more funding and stuff like that. I wanna switch gears a little bit and talk about biotech and startups. As we've talked about earlier, there's been this implosion of biotech startups recently, especially in Silicon Valley. Why do you think that is? What are the causes for this?

-是的，专注真的很难，特别是当你有更多的员工，你得到更多的资金和诸如此类的东西时。我想换个话题谈谈生物技术和初创公司。正如我们之前所说的，生物技术初创企业最近发生了一次内爆，特别是在硅谷。你觉得那是为什么？造成这种情况的原因是什么？

- The biotech industry is so interesting right now and it's actually amazing. It's not just here in Silicon Valley. It's everywhere. So, the UK, Cambridge, San Diego, everywhere, there's like lots and lots of biotech startups. And I think it's a really cool time for that sector of the industry. It's, I think, driven by a couple of things. One, capital, so access to capital was never, it's unprecedented. And, the amount of capital that's going into biotech is definitely unprecedented. There's also a sort of interesting evolution in terms of where biology is in terms of the actual therapeutic modalities that are available. So, I'm not sure that people sort of who are outside the industry may not kind of recognize this as a real turning point for biotech. Up until very recently there was really only small-molecule inhibitors and then after that, there was Genentech and Amgen so there was actual biologics, so antibodies and proteins. But, just in the last year, we had gene therapies approved. We had cell-based therapies approved. We had RNAi approved. It's actual marketable products for the first time. So, all of a sudden, you have this huge window opened up for you in the different types of approaches you can take that are viable to create a commercial product. So, I think the science has caught up to a point where there's just some phenomenal opportunities to tackle diseases in a way that was not possible previously.

-生物技术产业现在是如此的有趣，而且它实际上是惊人的。不仅仅是在硅谷。到处都是。所以，英国，剑桥，圣地亚哥，到处都有很多生物技术初创企业。我认为这对这个行业来说是个很酷的时刻。我想，这是由几件事驱动的。第一，资本，所以获得资本从来都不是，这是前所未有的。而且，投入生物技术的资本绝对是前所未有的。也有一种有趣的进化，在生物学的实际治疗方式方面。所以，我不确定是否有些人在这个行业之外没有意识到这是生物技术的一个真正的转折点。直到最近，只有小分子的抑制剂，然后，有基因和安进，所以有实际的生物制品，所以抗体和蛋白质。但是，就在去年，我们批准了基因疗法。我们已经批准了基于细胞的疗法。我们已经批准了RNAi。这是第一次真正适销对路的产品。所以，突然之间，你有了一个巨大的窗口为你打开了不同的方法，你可以采取的方法，是可行的，创造一个商业产品。因此，我认为科学已经发展到了这样一个阶段，那就是有一些惊人的机会可以一种以前不可能的方式来对付疾病。

- Interesting, sort of like Moore's Law in biotech to some extent.

-有趣，有点像生物技术中的摩尔定律。

- Yes, really, it's a really, really exciting time. There's also, I think, a convergence on really a critical mass of people looking at, okay, I have this experience in the pharmaceutical industry. I'm gonna go into the biotech industry. So, again, like just so many people with really great scientific experience, with true experience of bringing, not from academia actually, in industry, bringing drugs to market are now going into biotech and they're taking that risk and founding companies and being early employees in these like five-person companies. And I never had seen that previously. I think that's a new phenomenon as well.

-是的，真的，这是一个非常令人兴奋的时刻.还有，我认为，在相当多的人看来，我在制药业有这样的经验。我要进入生物技术产业。所以，再一次，就像很多有很好的科学经验的人一样，他们有真正的经验-而不是来自学术界-实际上，在工业领域，把药物带到市场上，现在他们进入了生物技术领域，他们冒着这个风险，创立了一些公司，并在这些公司做早期雇员。我以前从没见过。我认为这也是一种新现象。

- So you sit in this corner section of, you've built the software company, a marketplace software company, and that intersects with biotech, and then you have the perspective of advising lots of more-truer, I guess, biotech companies. What's the difference between biotech and software?

-所以你坐在这个角落里，你已经建立了软件公司，一个市场软件公司，它与生物技术交叉，然后你就有了给更多更真实的生物技术公司提供建议的视角。生物技术和软件有什么区别？

- It's so different.

-太不一样了

-Like in terms of running the startup itself.

-就像运行启动本身一样。

- Yeah, it's really different. I think, in some ways--

-是啊，真的不一样我想，在某些方面-

- Or, let me rephrase the question. How is it the same? Are there any similarities?

-或者，让我重新表述一下这个问题。怎么会一样？有什么相似之处吗？

- I think it's the same in terms of people, focus, funding, all of those things are kinda the same. So like, trying to find the right people and retain them, building a good culture, all of those things. Actually, I think YC has really been able to do a great job of having companies across different sectors because of that focus on really learning from successful entrepreneurs. So big lessons about creating a company and not so much about the very minute tactical details. Biotechs are different because you can't really change the outcome of the science. The science is the science. So either it works or it doesn't work. And, that's very different than software where you can actually pivot around and keep developing your product and keep getting product-market fit. With science it's about key milestones that demonstrate real inflection points in terms of mitigating the risk of the drug working. So, actually having like different stages along the development path where you've eventually got to a point where you demonstrate, in a clinical trial, that your drug is effective at treating the disease that you're trying to treat.

-我认为在人、焦点、资金等方面都是一样的，所有这些都是一样的。比如，试图找到合适的人并留住他们，建立一种良好的文化，所有这些。事实上，我认为YC在让不同行业的公司参与进来方面做得很好，因为他们专注于真正地向成功的企业家学习。关于创建一家公司的重要经验，而不是非常微小的战术细节。生物技术是不同的，因为你不能真正改变科学的结果。科学就是科学。所以要么起作用要么不起作用。而且，这与软件有很大的不同，在软件中，你可以围绕着你的产品，不断地开发你的产品，并不断地适应产品市场。与科学有关的关键里程碑，显示了真正的拐点，在降低风险的药物作用。所以，实际上，在不同的发展阶段，你最终会证明，在临床试验中，你的药物在治疗你想要治疗的疾病方面是有效的。

- What does an MVP mean in biotech?

-MVP在生物技术中意味着什么？

- I think MVP in biotech is, I don't even, I don't know if there is an MVP. So, for a biotech company that's in the therapeutic space really, you're not gonna have any commercial revenue until you have a approved product that is sold on the market which, actually, most biotechs never have. Most biotechs go through a process of developing new therapies and they do partnerships with large companies that fund the expensive clinical development of those products. And so that's really where a lot of them end up, kind of exiting. They're either acquired or they sell or partner their product in early clinical development. We're starting to see, which I think is really cool, some biotech companies actually commercialize their own products now. That was something that didn't happen for quite a long time. So, just recently, there's several companies that are actually selling their product themselves, so building their own sales force and distribution channels. Those challenges are really interesting. Mostly those companies are going after rare diseases where you can go after key opinion leaders and have a really efficient sales channel. But it's still really exciting to see them do that.

-我认为生物技术的MVP是，我甚至不知道是否有MVP因此，对于一家在治疗领域的生物技术公司来说，你将不会有任何商业收入，除非你有一种获得批准的产品在市场上销售，而事实上，大多数生物技术公司从来没有。大多数生物技术人员都经历了开发新疗法的过程，他们与大公司合作，为这些产品昂贵的临床开发提供资金。所以这就是他们中很多人最终的归宿，某种程度上的退出。他们要么被收购，要么在早期临床开发中销售或合作他们的产品。我们开始看到，我认为这真的很酷，一些生物技术公司实际上已经将他们自己的产品商业化了。这是很长一段时间没有发生的事情。所以，就在最近，有几家公司实际上是自己销售自己的产品，因此建立了自己的销售队伍和销售渠道。这些挑战真的很有趣。大多数情况下，这些公司都在追求罕见的疾病，在那里，你可以找到关键的意见领袖，并拥有一个真正有效的销售渠道。但看到他们这么做还是很令人兴奋的。

- That's great. Let me actually double-down on, double-click on that point you made. Essentially what you're saying is that I can bring my product to market without getting acquired, which used to be the case. At that specific juncture, what has changed that has allowed that to happen?

-太棒了让我双击，双击你说的那个点。本质上，你的意思是，我可以把我的产品推向市场，而不被收购，这是过去的情况。在这一特定时刻，是什么改变了这种情况？

- That's a good question. I think capital, so access to capital. Really important that the companies can actually access enough capital to get all the way through to approval. I also think the FDA has done some really interesting work trying to come up with reasonable clinical development strategies for, particularly, rare diseases where companies can actually get registration with a fairly small trial. So that makes it actually feasible for a small company to be able to do that. In terms of distribution, I do think that strategy of just building really strong patient advocacy networks, working with the key opinion leaders in the community through the hospitals that these patients are treated at, provides a way to distribute that, in the past, I think, if it's a blockbuster indication, it becomes very challenging. You have to build a huge sales force. You have to go and kind of sell this drug with sort of old-school pharmaceutical sales reps. It's not easy to do that.

-这是个好问题.我认为资本，所以获得资本。非常重要的是，这些公司能够真正获得足够的资金来获得所有的批准。我也认为FDA做了一些非常有趣的工作，试图想出合理的临床发展策略，特别是罕见的疾病，在这些疾病中，公司实际上可以在一个相当小的试验中获得注册。因此，对于一家小公司来说，能够做到这一点实际上是可行的。在分配方面，我确实认为，建立非常强大的病人宣传网络的策略，通过治疗这些病人的医院，与社区中的主要舆论领袖合作，提供了一种传播方式，在过去，我认为，如果这是一个巨大的迹象，它就会变得非常具有挑战性。你必须建立一支庞大的销售队伍。你得去和一些老派的药品销售代表一起卖这种药。这么做可不容易。

- I also see this proliferation of startups, maybe actually in this vein of Science Exchange where you're helping try to speed up like experiments, you're helping speed up trials, you're helping speed up getting through the FDA process and so that may be helping a little bit as well.

-我也看到了创业公司的激增，也许实际上是在科学交流的这一领域，你在尝试像实验一样加快速度，你帮助加快试验，你帮助加快通过FDA的过程，所以这也可能会有一点帮助。

- Yeah, definitely. Like we've funded some really interesting companies in this space that kind of put in place, for example, regulatory infrastructure for the FDA. So, the expertise is out there and people are starting to productize that in a way that, maybe, wasn't available previously. So people would have to go and hire a regulatory consultant and that would be very expensive, literally like more than a hundred thousand dollars, to come up with your FDA strategy. And now there are companies that you can actually go and work with them to provide the productized version of that process. So Enzyme is, the company that Y Combinator funded, which I think is super interesting, and all of these, are just enabling technologies that will, hopefully, provide the infrastructure similar to what we've seen in the software space.

-是的，当然.就像我们在这个领域资助了一些真正有趣的公司，比如FDA的监管基础设施。所以，专业技术已经存在，人们开始以一种以前不具备的方式来生产它。因此，人们必须去雇佣一位监管顾问，这将是非常昂贵的，就像超过10万美元，想出你的FDA战略。现在有一些公司，你可以去和他们合作，提供这个过程的生产版本。因此，YCombinator资助的公司，我认为这是非常有趣的，所有这些都只是使技术，希望能提供类似于我们在软件领域所看到的基础设施。

- Great, so, you've now, like we said before, advised, and you've mentored, hundreds of biotech founders at this point. What are some of the common mistakes you've seen biotech founders make and what are the ones that you just need to, like, what do you avoid at all costs 'cause it's they're so detrimental?

-太好了，就像我们之前说的，你现在已经为数百位生物技术创始人提供了建议和指导。你看到生物技术的创始人犯了哪些常见的错误，你只需要做些什么，比如，你不惜一切代价避免什么，因为他们是如此有害？

- I think our biotech founders, first of all, are really amazing because they are often those people who have taken that risk and have kind of stepped out of academia or other very established careers and said, I'm gonna go do this startup, and there isn't really that many role models for me to follow or success stories for me to follow. So, I think they themselves are incredibly impressive and often I do Office Hours with them and I'm like, I'm just learning from them. It's actually really, really cool. But, I think, one mistake I have seen people make is just, and I think all startup founders kind of do this, it's like not doing the killer experiment, like not actually just cutting to the chase and saying, okay, these are just the minimal things I need to do to truly answer the question. And you almost don't wanna do it because, if it doesn't work, the company's kind of dead. And I, sort of, a lotta the time push our companies a little bit. I'm like, but why haven't you done that experiment. That experiment would tell you today if this is gonna work or not. And I think it's just, it's hard when it's your own company to kind of do that but, the sooner you do it, the sooner you have enough money to kind of work on something else because, like we talked about with science, if you can't get the actual science to work, you really are in a difficult position.

-我认为我们的生物技术创始人，首先，是非常令人惊讶的，因为他们通常是那些冒着这种风险离开学术界或其他非常成熟的职业生涯的人，他们说，我要去做这个初创公司，我没有那么多的榜样值得我去学习，也没有什么成功的故事值得我去学习。所以，我认为他们自己是令人难以置信的令人印象深刻的，我经常和他们一起办公时间，我就像，我只是在向他们学习。其实真的很酷。但是，我认为，我看到人们犯的一个错误就是，我认为所有的初创公司创始人都是这样做的，就像不做杀手实验一样，不只是简单地说，好吧，这些只是我需要做的最简单的事情，才能真正回答这个问题。你几乎不想这么做，因为如果它不起作用，公司就会死掉。而我，差不多，很多时间，推动我们的公司一点点。我想，但你为什么不做那个实验。今天的实验会告诉你这是否可行。我认为这只是，当你自己的公司这么做是很困难的，但是，你越早这么做，你就越早有足够的钱去做其他的事情，因为，就像我们所说的科学，如果你不能让真正的科学发挥作用，你真的处于一个困难的境地。

- Say you're a scientist or you're an academic who's looking to get into startups. I think a lot of people still think, maybe you do, you need some kind of business co-founder to help me do X, Y and Z. What do you think about that and should that be a goal?

-假设你是一名科学家，或者你是一名希望进入初创企业的学者。我认为很多人仍然认为，也许你需要一些商业联合创始人来帮助我做X，Y和Z。你认为这是一个目标吗？

- No, I don't think that should be a goal. I actually do have a business co-founder so he would probably be mad that I say that but, and he's great, and I literally couldn't have built Science Exchange without him but, but not because of his business background, because he's a great co-founder. 'cause he like hustles and figures stuff out and we work well together. I think business, so much of it is just common sense. I used to get so concerned that I didn't have this finance background. I didn't know how to read all of the income statements and all that. And then, I realized, after a while, okay, I'm just gonna sit down with my business co-founder and he's gonna teach me. So he taught me and then I was like, oh, that's so obvious. It's definitely not rocket science. So, I think that the business side, you really, as a CEO, when you grow the company one of the key skills is actually recognizing the areas that you're good at and bad at and where you should be investing in bringing in top talent. So, for us, we recently actually hired a CFO. So, a year ago, we hired a CFO. And that's been, I think, good for the company but also good from a perception perspective. So as the company reaches a growth stage, actually having that sort of legitimate CFO person does help you. Starting out, you should just find people who really wanna solve the same problem as you and really care about it and also who you really like working with because that's, by far, the most important thing.

-不，我不认为那应该是个目标.我确实有一位商业联合创始人，所以他可能会因为我这么说而生气，但是，他很棒，没有他，我几乎不可能建立科学交流，但不是因为他的商业背景，因为他是一个伟大的联合创始人。因为他喜欢手忙脚乱，想办法解决问题，我们合作得很好。我认为生意，很多都是常识。我以前很担心我没有这个财务背景。我不知道如何阅读所有的损益表。然后，我意识到，过了一会儿，好吧，我要和我的商业联合创始人坐下来，他会教我的。所以他教我，然后我说，哦，这太明显了。这绝对不是火箭科学。所以，我认为商业方面，作为一名首席执行官，当你成长公司的时候，关键技能之一实际上是认识到你擅长的领域和糟糕的领域，以及你应该投资引进顶级人才的领域。因此，对我们来说，我们最近实际上雇用了一名财务总监。一年前我们雇了一位财务总监。我认为，这对公司来说是件好事，但从感知的角度来看也是好事。因此，当公司发展到一个阶段时，有这样一个合法的首席财务官确实对你有帮助。首先，你应该找到那些真正想要解决和你一样的问题的人，真正关心这个问题的人，以及你真正喜欢与之共事的人，因为到目前为止，这是最重要的事情。

- On the flip side, if you're not a scientist, and, like say you're a programmer, but you're interested in getting into biotech, what should you do? Should I go back to school, get my PhD? What's a potential path for me?

另一方面，如果你不是科学家，比如说你是个程序员，但你对生物技术感兴趣，你该怎么办呢？我该回学校去拿博士学位吗？对我来说有什么潜在的道路？

- That's a good question. Part of me thinks you should go back to school. I think there is this, there's a lot of interest from Silicon Valley in biotech. People are super interested in, just like, even just hacking themselves, like this whole kind of movement around really personalized understanding all of your own biology. I think it's really cool. And I, by the way, do think that the future of biotech and where I always think about for Reformer and the work that we're doing, is, I believe that the future will definitely involve a strong component of user pays. So, I think the products that are developed will have to be in indications that the patients are actually willing to pay for. And there's a lot of research at the moment that's in areas which I think are potentially problematic because they're sort of diseases where people are not really that sick or they don't really feel sick, and so getting them to adhere to those medications, very, very challenging. In contrast, things like migraine drugs, actually Amgen's migraine drug, has outperformed its predictions in the market by 10 times. I think that's because people generally go to the doctor 'cause they are debilitated by migraines and they will pay for those drugs. So, I think, trying to think about ways that you can focus on users is good. Anyway, to go back to your question 'cause I got sidetracked, about should computer programmers, what should they do, I think, for biology and actual scientific research, there is this element of just getting in the lab and truly understanding how experiments are designed and how to interpret them, which I don't know that you can just learn from not doing. But then, there is a lot of use for, for example, bioinformatics and other analysis tools and platforms where people can get involved without having lab experience. And we do have some success for companies in Y Combinator that are founded by non-scientific founders that are in the biotech space. Notable Labs is one that I think is incredibly impressive. The founders have basically self-taught themselves everything about the sector that they're in and they're super smart and hungry and straightaway when I interviewed them, I was like, yeah, they know just as much as PhDs who work in the space.

-这是个好问题.我觉得你应该回学校去。我认为，硅谷对生物技术有很大的兴趣。人们非常感兴趣，就像黑客攻击自己一样，就像这种围绕你自己生物学的真正个性化的运动。我觉得很酷。顺便说一句，我认为生物技术的未来，以及我一直在考虑的改革者和我们正在做的工作，我相信未来肯定会涉及到用户付费的强大组成部分。因此，我认为所开发的产品必须有患者愿意支付的迹象。目前有很多研究，我认为这些领域有潜在的问题，因为它们是一种疾病，人们不是真的生病，也不是真的觉得不舒服，所以让他们坚持这些药物，非常有挑战性。相比之下，像偏头痛药物，实际上安进的偏头痛药物，在市场上的表现比它的预测高出10倍。我认为这是因为人们通常会去看医生，因为他们因偏头痛而衰弱，他们会为这些药物买单。所以，我认为，试着思考你可以把注意力集中在用户身上的方式是好的。无论如何，回到你的问题，因为我被转移了，关于计算机程序员应该做什么，我认为，对于生物学和实际的科学研究，有一个要素就是进入实验室，真正理解实验是如何设计的，以及如何解释它们，我不知道你能从不做中学到什么。但是，有很多用途，例如，生物信息学和其他分析工具和平台，人们可以在没有实验室经验的情况下参与其中。我们在YCombinator的公司确实取得了一些成功，这些公司是由生物技术领域的非科学创建者创立的。值得注意的实验室是一个我认为是令人难以置信的令人印象深刻的实验室。创始人基本上都自学了他们所处的领域，他们非常聪明，饥肠辘辘，当我采访他们的时候，我觉得，是的，他们知道的和在这个领域工作的博士一样多。

- So two more questions. One is, just going back to Science Exchange for a minute, looking back, of all the decisions you've made in the early days, aside from just starting the startup itself, that's obviously very critical but, what's a decision you made where you're, looking back, you're like, that was a game changer, that was an inflection point in my business?

所以还有两个问题一个是，回到科学交流，回顾一下，在你早期所做的所有决定中，除了刚刚开始创业本身，这显然是非常关键的，但是，你所做的决定是什么，回顾过去，你就像，那是一个改变游戏规则的人，那是我的事业中的一个转折点？

- Wow, that is a good question. Game changer. Actually, I think the decision to do the Reproducibility Initiative was a game changer and it was non-obvious. So, in some ways, the Reproducibility Initiative goes against focus. It was kind of a distraction. Like, okay, we're gonna do this project, but it's not directly related to just growing the marketplace, although the marketplace was used to run the project. But, it was so timely and so high-profile that it did change the branding and the opportunities for Science Exchange in a way that we never expected. And it did open all of the doors that eventually led to our pharmaceutical partnerships, to really like a lot of the success of Science Exchange. So that was probably one example.

-哇，这是个好问题。改变游戏规则。实际上，我认为做复制倡议的决定是一个改变游戏规则的决定，这是不明显的。因此，在某些方面，可复制性倡议与焦点背道而驰。有点让人分心。就像，好吧，我们要做这个项目，但这与扩大市场没有直接关系，尽管市场是用来运行这个项目的。但是，这是如此及时，如此高调，以至于它确实改变了品牌和科学交流的机会，这是我们从未料到的。它确实打开了所有的大门，最终导致了我们的医药合作伙伴关系，真正喜欢科学交流的成功。这可能就是一个例子。

- Awe, interesting. I did not know. When I saw it, I was like, oh, wow, Science Exchange, I knew it could be big. But it could be like this much bigger 'cause it just showed what you could do with it. Okay, last question is, it's always my favorite question, in a hundred years from now, you're only, you've been around for eight years, seven to eight years now, but in a hundred years from now, what do you think Science Exchange will be?

-敬畏，有趣我不知道。当我看到它的时候，我就想，哦，哇，科学交流，我知道它会很大。但它可能会大得多，因为它显示了你能用它做什么。好的，最后一个问题是，这一直是我最喜欢的问题，一百年后，你只是，你已经存在了八年，七到八年，但是再过一百年，你认为科学交流会是什么？

- That is such an interesting question because I think, if you just think about what the world will be like in a hundred years from now, I'm not sure any of us have a good answer. But, I do think that a hundred years ago, the scientific method existed and people were doing scientific research, and I think scientific research will exist a hundred years from now. So Science Exchange has always been extremely purpose-driven. The company's purpose is to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections. So I think whatever the world looks like at that time, that's what Science Exchange will be doing and hopefully we're just providing that infrastructure that enables people to instantly work with whoever they need to collaborate with in order to make these scientific breakthroughs happen.

-这是一个很有趣的问题，因为我认为，如果你想想一百年后的世界会是什么样子，我不确定我们中的任何一个人都有一个好的答案。但是，我确实认为一百年前，科学方法已经存在，人们正在进行科学研究，我认为一百年后科学研究就会存在。因此，科学交流一直是极具目的性的。该公司的宗旨是通过联系实现科学突破。所以我认为，无论当时世界是什么样子，这就是科学交流所要做的，希望我们只是提供基础设施，让人们能够立即与任何他们需要合作的人合作，以实现这些科学突破。

- It's crazy to think the scientific method was only discovered or invented or whatever you wanna call it just not long ago, and which created this explosion of science in general. Okay, cool. Well that's all the questions I have. Any questions from the audience? Back there. You repeat it all.

-认为科学方法只是在不久前才被发现或发明，或者你想把它称为什么，这真是太疯狂了，它创造了整个科学的爆炸。好吧，酷。这就是我要问的所有问题。观众有什么问题吗？后面。你都重复一遍。

- [Audience Member] Given that you've touched on reproducibility several times now and I believe one of the problems is that we use statistical methods to show correlation on causality, how open do you think the industry is in terms of taking newer approaches that might tend towards causality as a research methodology?

-[听众]考虑到您已经多次谈到可重现性，我认为问题之一是，我们使用统计方法来显示因果关系的相关性，您认为行业在采取可能倾向于因果关系的较新方法作为研究方法方面有多开放？

- So the question is about whether we should look at new approaches to, instead of just looking at correlations, to look for causality.

-因此，问题在于我们是否应该研究新的方法，而不是仅仅关注相关性，以寻找因果关系。

- [Audience Member] Yeah, especially in the space with unknown unknowns.

-[观众]是的，特别是在未知的空间里。

- Especially in a space with unknown unknowns. So, I think the way that, so I'm a biologist by training so I tend to think that we're not just looking at correlations. We try to design experiments that allow us to change something in the system that is a controlled system and then read an output from that and determine whether that fits of our hypothesis that we changed something and it has, therefore, had this downstream impact. I think there's really interesting work that's been done on correlations, particularly with real-world data so trying to look for ways that we can actually use humans in the wild to examine new theories that we have and then apply those back into the lab. But, at a basic level, when you're in the lab, you are kind of using model systems to try to reduce the unknown unknowns so that you can test specific theories.

-特别是在一个未知的空间。所以，我这样想，所以我是一个生物学家，通过训练，我倾向于认为我们不仅仅是在研究相关性。我们试着设计实验，让我们改变系统中的一些东西，这是一个受控系统，然后读取其中的一个输出，并确定这是否符合我们的假设，即我们改变了什么，因此，它已经产生了这种下游的影响。我认为在相关性方面已经做了非常有趣的工作，特别是在现实世界的数据中，所以我们试图寻找方法，让我们能够在野外使用人类来检验我们所拥有的新理论，然后将这些理论应用到实验室中。但是，在一个基本的层次上，当你在实验室的时候，你是在使用模型系统来尝试减少未知的未知，这样你就可以测试特定的理论。

- [Audience Member] Thank you. You talked about how you basically went from idea to what was basically a minimum viable product in a very short space of time. What were the keys steps for you to do that?

-[观众]谢谢。你谈到了你是如何在很短的时间内从创意发展到最基本可行的产品的。你做那件事的关键步骤是什么？

- So the question is about going from an idea to an MVP in a short space of time and the steps that were required to do that. For us, actually, that was one of the lessons that I really took when I started Science Exchange was, try to do something really quickly and get it off the ground because I see a lot of people start companies and they have a lot of enthusiasm at the start. And then they're also working like full-time jobs and trying to do this on the side. The progress you make, obviously, is limited because you just don't have the time to put into it. So, where possible, I think it's really great if you can kinda just take time out to say, okay, I'm gonna do like Y Combinator or something for three months and really launch the company. For us, we literally had the idea and then it was the, I think it was February 2011, and we kind of were talking about different ideas and then we thought, this is really a good idea. And so then we applied to Y Combinator. So we made this video, and it was just me and my co-founder. We had nothing. Then, actually Y Combinator, Alexis Ohanian, he Skyped me and he said, "You're not gonna get in." And I was like, oh no, why? And he was like, "Because you don't have a technical co-founder "and you really need a technical co-founder." So we then spoke to all of our friends and we found a technical co-founder. And this was always in like two weeks and then we built, actually, a really hacked-together version of the MVP and we came to our interview. And we had already got something kind of, it was very basic, but we had something. Then we got in and we moved out here in May. And it was three months of just, okay, now let's get that launched. And we were actually doing transactions off platforms. So we actually were talking with all of our scientists and I was traveling a lot talking to all of the people who I could get to use the product. So we actually did hundreds of thousands of dollars of transactions during that time just to prove that we understood the demand and the supply side, and started to build what would become the product.

-所以问题是在很短的时间内从一个想法变成一个MVP，以及要做到这一点所需要的步骤。对我们来说，这是我在创办科学交流公司时真正学到的一条经验，那就是，试着尽快做一些事情，然后把它做好，因为我看到很多人创办了公司，他们一开始就有很大的热情。然后，他们也像全职工作一样工作，并试图在一边做这件事。很明显，你所取得的进步是有限的，因为你没有时间投入其中。所以，在可能的情况下，我认为如果你能花点时间说，好吧，我会像Y组合器这样做三个月，然后真正启动公司，那就太好了。对我们来说，我们确实有了这个想法，然后是，我认为是2011年2月，我们讨论的是不同的想法，然后我们认为，这是一个很好的主意。然后我们应用于Y组合器。所以我们拍了这段视频，只有我和我的联合创始人。我们什么都没有。然后，实际上Y组合，Alexis Ohanian，他打了我，他说，“你不能进去。”我说，哦，不，为什么？他说，“因为你没有技术上的联合创始人”，你真的需要一个技术上的联合创始人。于是我们和我们的朋友们谈了谈，我们找到了一位技术上的联合创始人。而这总是在大约两周后，我们建立了，实际上，一个真正的黑客版本的MVP，我们来到了我们的采访。我们已经得到了一些东西，这是非常基本的，但是我们有一些东西。然后我们在五月搬到这里。三个月过去了，好吧，现在让我们启动它。我们实际上是在平台上进行交易。所以我们实际上是和我们所有的科学家交谈，我旅行了很多次，和所有我可以使用这个产品的人交谈。因此，在这段时间里，我们进行了数十万美元的交易，只是为了证明我们了解需求和供应方面，并开始建造将成为产品的产品。

- [Audience Member] So you mentioned that in the case of getting a PhD or something like that that going back to school would not be a main thing that we might need to do. But, if you're going into something like biotech and, I guess this is for both you and her, how seriously do you take an application, especially in biotech when there's no doctor or there is nobody from a established medical university with an established degree? And then the second part is, then, when you go and talk to other scientists, the scientific community, how seriously would they take you if you do not have those credentials on paper?

-[听众]所以你提到过，在获得博士学位或诸如此类的情况下，回到学校并不是我们可能需要做的主要事情。但是，如果你要学习生物技术-我想这对你和她来说都是如此-你对申请有多认真，尤其是在生物技术领域，没有医生，或者没有来自有固定学位的知名医科大学的人？然后第二部分是，当你去和其他科学家，科学界交谈时，如果你没有这些证书的话，他们会认真对待你吗？

- So the question is about the importance of credentials in the biotech space. I think credentials are very important. So, if you can have credentials in the space it's gonna give you, obviously, a huge advantage. But, in saying that, I don't think it's, We have examples where people have been successful without that. And how they were successful is by being incredibly credible themselves when you actually interview them. In the example of Notable Labs, when I interviewed Matt and Pete, they just had researched everything about the space. They'd read every scientific paper. They knew in-depth about cancer stem cells, about the limitations, about the assays that they wanted to use. I met with them much longer than I would have if I had a surrogate, which would be the credential of them having a PhD from a top university. But by talking to them, it was clear that they did understand the space and that they were incredibly motivated, due to a family connection, to really try to put something in place that could help solve this issue which was, in the case of them, they were looking for new therapeutics for glioblastoma. So, I think if you are not a scientist, having a personal driver of why you're doing this actually can serve as a surrogate to get you in the door. So it can get you meetings with top scientists. It can get you meetings with patient advocacy groups that can help you sort of get the company started.

-因此，问题在于证书在生物技术领域的重要性。我认为证书很重要。所以，如果你能在空间里有凭据的话，很明显，它会给你带来巨大的优势。但是，说到这一点，我不认为这是，我们有一些例子，人们在没有成功的情况下。当你采访他们的时候，他们是如何获得成功的。在著名实验室的例子中，当我采访马特和皮特时，他们只是研究了这个空间的一切。他们看了每一篇科学论文。他们对癌症干细胞、限制因素以及他们想要使用的检测方法都有深入的了解。我和他们见面的时间比如果我有一个代孕母亲的话要长得多，这将是他们从顶尖大学获得博士学位的资格证书。但是通过与他们交谈，很明显他们确实了解这个空间，而且由于家庭的联系，他们有着难以置信的动机，他们真的想要找到一些能够帮助解决这个问题的东西，在他们的例子中，他们正在寻找新的治疗胶质母细胞瘤的药物。所以，我认为，如果你不是一个科学家，有一个私人的司机，你为什么要这么做，实际上可以作为一个代孕，让你进门。这样你就能和顶尖的科学家见面。它可以让你与耐心的倡导团体会面，这些团体可以帮助你启动公司。

- [Audience Member] So if your purpose is strong enough and if you can articulate that, that can compensate for that PhD.

-[听众]所以如果你的目标足够强烈，如果你能表达出来，那就可以弥补博士学位的不足。

- I think it can. I think if you're building a biotech company, you obviously have to build a scientific team. And then you'll end up with PhDs on your team. But, you can be a co-founder without a PhD.

-我想是可以的.我认为如果你要建立一家生物技术公司，你显然必须建立一个科学团队。然后你就会在你的团队中获得博士学位。但是，你可以在没有博士学位的情况下成为联合创始人。

- [Audience Member] Thank you.

-[观众]谢谢。

- [Audience Member] In this process of like the idea to, like the the act of coming here and everything, when you decide to leave the university?

-[观众]在这个过程中，喜欢的想法，比如来这里的行为和一切，当你决定离开大学？

- The question is about when did I decide to leave the university. I was so fortunate when I started Science Exchange and I think a lot of people don't realize how difficult, and I totally don't take this for granted like when people ask me about our journey of starting Science Exchange. I think we had enormous luck, in a sense, that my boss was the dean of medicine at the University of Miami and he was incredibly supportive of Science Exchange. So he thought it was a great idea. He thought that if I didn't do it, then somebody else would do it. And so he actually let me take three months off to go and do this and he looked after my lab for me while I was gone. And then, once we were out here, it was clear that the idea was gonna be successful and we raised funding straight out of YC and so I decided I'm not gonna go back. I was actually nervous about telling him I wasn't gonna go back. But he was so amazing about it. He was just like, "Yeah, no, it's doing great. "I knew it would be a great success." So having that mentor who gave me the opportunity, I think not many people get that, especially in academia. That's actually, again, where I sometimes have this frustration of I hear the opposite of PhD students and postdocs. They tell me, oh my boss just really didn't want me to leave. Like, really didn't want me to start a company, actively worked against me rather than helped me. And I think about my experience and how different it would have been if I didn't have his support.

-问题是我什么时候决定离开这所大学的。当我开始科学交流的时候，我很幸运，我想很多人没有意识到有多难，我完全不认为这是理所当然的，就像当人们问我启动科学交流的旅程时。我认为我们非常幸运，从某种意义上说，我的老板是迈阿密大学医学系主任，他非常支持科学交流。所以他觉得这是个好主意。他认为如果不是我干的，就会有人干。所以他让我放了三个月的假去做这件事，他在我不在的时候替我照看我的实验室。然后，一旦我们来到这里，很明显这个想法会成功，我们直接从YC筹集资金，所以我决定不回去了。我很紧张地告诉他我不会回去了。但他太棒了。他就像，“是的，不，做得很好。“我知道这会是一个巨大的成功。”因此，有了给我这个机会的导师，我想没有多少人能理解这一点，尤其是在学术界。事实上，我有时会感到沮丧，因为我听到了博士生和博士后的相反声音。他们告诉我，哦，我老板真的不想让我离开。就像，真的不想让我开一家公司，主动地和我一起工作，而不是帮助我。我想到了我的经历，如果我没有他的支持，我会有多大的不同。

- All right, last question, right here.

好了最后一个问题就在这里

- [Audience Member] How exactly did you match the expectations from both sides. Like what the demand side expected of the supply and the supply like especially when you started to control the quality of the perception for both sides?

-[观众]你到底是如何达到双方的期望的？比如需求方对供给的期望和供给，尤其是当你开始控制双方感知的质量时？

- The question's about quality control in a two-sided marketplace. For us, quality control is incredibly important and actually is one of the core value propositions of Science Exchange. We qualify all suppliers before they're available through the marketplace. And then we also have a continuous monitoring process where we actually look at performance of every single transaction. We have more data on performance than anybody else. We can actually say with certainty, well, at least, more certainty than other people, this provider will likely do a very good job on this type of experiment. We also put in place, the way our actual platform is structured, there are clear outline of the deliverables that are generated, the expectations are set up front and I think a really interesting stat that we track closely is, Science Exchange's Net Promoter Score is 78 and our suppliers Net Promoter Score is 67. And the industry average is zero. So we think that's amazing because it's the same suppliers, but, when used through the platform, they perform much better. I think the reason is because it's structured and it's clearly outlined what's gonna be delivered. And then there's an expectation that, if you don't perform, that information will actually be available to everyone else when they're making a decision. So it becomes a very strong incentive for people to perform and make sure that they're delivering what they agreed upon.

-问题是关于双边市场的质量控制。对我们来说，质量控制是非常重要的，实际上也是科学交流的核心价值主张之一。我们在供应商通过市场之前对他们进行资格认证。然后，我们还有一个持续的监视过程，在这个过程中，我们实际上查看每一个事务的性能。我们比任何人都有更多的性能数据。我们可以肯定地说，至少，比其他人更确定，这个提供者很可能在这种实验中做得很好。我们还建立了，我们的实际平台的构建方式，有清晰的可交付成果大纲，预期是建立在前面的，我认为一个非常有趣的统计数据是，我们密切跟踪的是，科学交易所的净启动评分是78，我们的供应商的净启动得分是67。行业平均值为零。所以我们认为这是很棒的，因为它是相同的供应商，但是，当通过平台使用时，他们的表现要好得多。我认为原因是因为它是结构化的，并且清楚地概述了将要交付的内容。还有一个期望，如果你不去做，当其他人做出决定的时候，这些信息实际上都是可以得到的。因此，这就成为了一种非常强烈的激励，促使人们去执行并确保他们所达成的协议得以实现。

- All right. Thank you so much Elizabeth.

-好吧非常感谢伊丽莎白。

- Sure, thank you.

当然，谢谢

- Thank you everyone.
