# A Conversation with Andy Bromberg - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

#与安迪·布罗姆伯格的对话-由杰夫·罗尔斯顿主持

\- Today is Thursday, which usually means that Adora or myself sit up here with someone notable, and have a hopefully interesting conversation.

\-今天是星期四，这通常意味着阿多拉或我自己坐在这里，与一个有名的人，并希望有一个有趣的谈话。

The someone notable we have today is Andy Bromberg, my friend and the president of CoinList, the president and co-founder of CoinList, which is this really fascinating company that is doing some interesting things we'll talk about. But Andy, maybe we can start by you talking a little bit about your entrepreneurial background, because interestingly, even though you graduated from Stanford a couple years ago, CoinList isn't your first venture, is it?

我们今天要关注的人是Andy Bromberg，我的朋友，Coinlist的总裁，Coinlist的总裁兼联合创始人，这是一个非常迷人的公司，正在做一些有趣的事情，我们将讨论。但是，安迪，也许我们可以从你谈谈你的创业背景开始，因为有趣的是，即使你几年前从斯坦福大学毕业，Coinlist不是你的第一个创业项目，是吗?

\- No, that's right. First of all, thank you for having me, and thank you everyone for coming, this is gonna be a lot of fun.

\-不，那是对的。首先，谢谢你邀请我，谢谢大家的到来，这将是一个很大的乐趣。

The entrepreneurial background for me started even before school, in high school, I was one of those people that started some web design and marketing businesses, nothing really notable, but I think it was really valuable to get that initial experience of building something and hiring a team and managing a team, and firing people, and figuring out how to do--

我的创业背景早在上学之前就已经开始了，高中时，我就是那些从事一些网页设计和市场营销业务的人中的一个，没有什么特别值得注意的，但我认为获得最初的经验，建立一些东西，雇用一个团队，管理一个团队，解雇一个人，并想办法做些什么，这是非常有价值的--

\- Did you do all those things while you were in high school?

\-你高中的时候做过那些事吗?

\- I did, yeah, I got started, it was a lot of fun doing that.

\-我做了，是的，我开始了，做那件事很有趣。

\- What made you do that? What was it about being an entrepreneur that attracted you while you were still in high school? God, in high school, I was worried about other things.

\-你为什么这么做? 当你还在高中的时候，作为一个企业家吸引了你，这是什么呢? 天啊，高中的时候，我还在担心别的事情。

\- It was really nothing about being an entrepreneur, and more about not wanting to do other jobs that I was able to do when I was in high school. You know, you can sit there, and you can do whatever, serve pizza, or scoop ice cream, or whatever it is.

\--这真的不是关于做一个企业家的问题，更多的是关于我在高中时不想做我能做的其他工作的问题。你知道，你可以坐在那里，你可以做任何事，提供披萨，或勺冰淇淋，或其他任何事情。

\- I worked in a supermarket.

\-我在超市工作。

It was awesome.

太棒了。

\- I did the scooping ice cream, too, yeah, it was fun, but I was looking at it and saying, all these businesses in my town have awful websites, and I've got a bunch of friends that do this stuff in their spare time, and that seems like just a way better way to make a little bit of money while I'm in high school than serving pizza. So I went into that, and expanded out to videos, marketing, photos, all that stuff, ran a few websites that did pretty well. But it was really less of I want to be an entrepreneur, and more of I really don't want to do these other jobs.

\--我也吃了冰淇淋，是的，很有趣，但我看着它说，我镇上所有的生意都有糟糕的网站，我有一群朋友在业余时间做这些事情，这似乎是在我高中时挣点钱比吃披萨更好的方法。因此，我深入其中，并扩展到视频，市场营销，照片，所有的东西，运行了一些网站，做得很好。但我真的不想成为一个企业家，更多的人真的不想做这些其他的工作。

And it then developed into a love for building things from the ground up and trying to create, but at the time it was purely an alternative, not a primary.

然后，它发展成为一种爱，从地面上建造东西，并试图创造，但在当时，它纯粹是一种选择，而不是一个主要的。

\- So you were really weren't thinking of this as, I'm an entrepreneur, and I'm gonna, my family's been entrepreneurs forever, it was more an escape, an alternate route from sort of the normal high school, I'm gonna get some, maybe not so interesting job and do something more interesting.

\-所以你真的不认为这是，我是一个企业家，我将，我的家人一直都是企业家，这是一种逃避，一种普通高中的替代路线，我将得到一些，也许不是那么有趣的工作，做一些更有趣的事情。

And probably you made a lot more money doing it, too.

或许你也赚了更多的钱。

\- Yeah, absolutely, and I think, and not to fall into some of the immediate startup cliches, but I was doing stuff that I really enjoyed doing.

\--是的，当然，而且我认为，不要陷入一些直接的初创公司陈词滥调，但我正在做一些我真的很喜欢做的事情。

I was hanging out with my friends, and building things, which was really fun, I enjoyed that. We built a bunch of websites around just things that we liked, and it wasn't necessarily that we're looking at it and saying, I'm gonna analyze this opportunity and do my TAM calculation and figure out this and the business strategy, we just said, I love playing soccer, what if I made a website that reviewed soccer cleats? We're like, alright, let's do that, and we made one of those, it did really well.

我和朋友们一起出去玩，做一些非常有趣的东西，我很喜欢。我们围绕着我们喜欢的东西建立了一大堆网站，我们并不一定要看着它，说，我会分析这个机会，做我的TAM计算，想出这个和商业策略，我们说，我喜欢踢足球，如果我做了一个网站，审查足球鞋呢? 我们就像，好吧，让我们这样做，我们做了其中一个，它做得真的很好。

I like messing around with computers, let's build one around how to dig into the internals of a Mac and do things with it. Let's build that, that did pretty well.

我喜欢玩弄电脑，让我们围绕着如何挖掘Mac的内部并用它做一些事情来构建一个。让我们来建造它，它做得很好。

And it was really based on these things that we just enjoyed doing, we had figured out how to do and wanted to build these sites around our passions.

它真的是基于这些我们喜欢做的事情，我们已经想出了如何做，并希望建立这些网站围绕着我们的热情。

\- I'm intrigued, so this was going pretty well. You're probably a senior in high school, you get into a little school on the West Coast, did you ever have the thought like, I'm not going to Stanford, I'm gonna just, I am the next, whatever, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm going?

\-我很感兴趣，所以这件事进行得很顺利。你可能是高中四年级的学生，你进了西海岸的一所小学校，你有没有想过，我不会去斯坦福，我只是，我是下一个，随便了，马克·扎克伯格，我要去?

\- Yeah, I don't, I think those really, truly would have been delusions of grandeur at that point.

\-是的，我不认为，我认为那些真的，真的会在那一刻是一种伟大的幻想。

These were little things, they were fun, and they made money, and I covered my expenses and was able to do what I wanted to do, but none of these were going to be massive businesses. Sure, of course, the thought occurs, you're like, ah, I could just keep doing this, I'm surviving on this, this would be fun. But ultimately, I got a great opportunity to go to a great school and decided to do that.

这些都是小事，他们很有趣，他们赚了钱，我支付了我的费用，并能够做我想做的事，但这些都不会是大规模的业务。当然，这种想法当然会发生，你就像，啊，我可以一直这么做，我靠这个活下去，这会很有趣的。但最终，我得到了一个很好的机会去一所很好的学校，并决定这样做。

And continued to do them for a little while while I was there, and did some of that stuff, but kind of trailed off during the couple years I was there, and then eventually kind of tailed off completely.

当我在那里的时候，我继续做了一段时间，并且做了一些那些事情，但是在那几年里，我有点落后了，最后还是完全落后了。

\- The idea of starting companies didn't, because apparently the bug hit you again while you were at Stanford, right?

\-创办公司的想法没有，因为很明显，你在斯坦福的时候又被臭虫打中了，对吗?

\- Yeah, that's right.

\-是的，没错。

I was there for a couple years, had a lot of fun. Really, actually, the most impactful bit there was tied into this whole entrepreneurship thing, which is I took this amazing class wen I was there called Startup Engineering from a guy named Balaji Srinivasan, who's now the CTO of Coinbase, and formerly the CEO of earn.com, and formerly a partner at Andreesen Horowitz, and founder of Counsyl.

我在那里呆了几年，玩得很开心。实际上，最有影响力的一点是，我参加了一个叫“创业工程”的课程，我来自一个叫巴拉吉·斯里尼瓦桑的人，他现在是Coinbase的首席技术官，曾是Earn.com的首席执行官，曾是AndreesenHorowitz的合伙人，Counsyl的创始人。

Amazing guy, who actually lectured at the very first-ever Startup School.

一个很棒的家伙，他在第一所创业学校授课。

And he taught this class about, I think a lot of times university classes around entrepreneurship don't teach you the real skills you need to start a business.

他教授这门课，我认为很多时候大学的创业课程并不能教会你创业所需要的真正技能。

They might teach you some really high-level things, or really basic fundamentals, but nothing around the pragmatic steps, and he set out to build a class, much like this one, that said, no, if you're actually going to do this, what do you need to do? And it was a lot of time with guest lecturers coming to the class, there was a lot of time with, things like it was a computer science class, how do you deploy code, how do you do revision control on code, and how do you put it on Github, and how do you do these different things, the practical pieces.

他们可能会教你一些真正的高层次的东西，或者真正的基础知识，但没有围绕着务实的步骤，他开始建立一个课程，很像这个，说，不，如果你真的要这样做，你需要做什么? 这是一段很长的时间，客座讲师来上课，有很多时间，比如计算机科学课程，如何部署代码，如何对代码进行修订控制，如何将代码放到GitHub上，以及如何做这些不同的事情，实际的部分。

And we took this class, a bunch of us, and had an amazing time, and actually out of that, which we'll come full circle back to this, a small set of folks that were in that class ended up founding the Stanford Bitcoin Group, back in 2012-2013.

我们上了这门课，我们中的一群人，经历了一段令人惊叹的时光，事实上，我们将回到这门课，在2012-2013年期间，一小群人最终成立了斯坦福比特币集团(stanford bitcoin group)。

\- I hope they bought some Bitcoin.

\-我希望他们买了比特币。

\- Not enough, never enough. So he convinced us all, this Bitcoin thing is gonna be real.

\-不够，永远不够。所以他说服了我们，比特币的事会是真的。

At the time, we're looking at him and saying, no way, man.

当时，我们看着他说，没门，伙计。

I mean, this is 2012, we're like Bitcoin is magic internet money, I don't believe you for a second, this doesn't work.

我的意思是，这是2012年，我们就像比特币是神奇的网络货币，我不相信你一秒钟，这不工作。

And he said, come on, let's do it, and so we started the Stanford Bitcoin Group, and spent a couple years in school doing a lot of awesome research and evangelism and had a lot of fun running around teaching people about crypto, and building things, and researching things. But then, yeah, ultimately I did end up leaving to start a different company, and left even that behind.

他说，来吧，让我们来吧，所以我们成立了斯坦福比特币集团，花了几年的时间在学校里做了很多令人敬畏的研究和传福音，并且在周围跑来跑去，教人们密码学，造东西，研究东西。但是，是的，最终我还是离开了开了一家不同的公司，甚至离开了那家公司。

\- So that different company was Sidewire, which interestingly seems like it's more relevant today, maybe more than Bitcoin, because it was all about real news, right?

\--那家不同的公司是“侧线”公司，有趣的是，今天它似乎更有意义，也许比比特币更有意义，因为它都是关于真实新闻的，对吗?

\- Yeah, so I built this platform called Sidewire, and I left school in 2014 to start this company, and I left early because I found what I think is the perfect partner for it, my co-founder Tucker, who had a background in politics, and I had this background in computer science, and building things, and we came together to build this product that was a platform where the experts in politics could chat publicly about the news of the day, and everyone else could read and engage, but not participate on that same level. We wanted to build kind of Twitter without the noise. What if you took just the experts and put them in conversation with each other? And we did this really around the 2016 election. So it was 2014 to, we ended up winding it down last year at 2017, but--

\-是的，所以我建立了一个名为sidewire的平台，我在2014年离开学校成立了这家公司，我很早就离开了，因为我发现我认为它的完美合作伙伴，我的联合创始人塔克，他在政治方面有背景，我在计算机科学和建筑方面有这样的背景，我们一起构建了这个产品，这个产品是一个平台，政治专家可以公开谈论当时的新闻，而其他人却无法阅读和参与。我们想建立一种没有噪音的Twitter。如果你带上专家，让他们互相交谈呢? 我们真的是围绕2016年的选举进行的。所以这是2014年，我们去年在2017年结束了它，但是--

\- It sounds like we need it really badly.

\-听起来我们真的很需要它。

\- I think we still do.

\-我想我们还是有的。

And I talk to a lot of people that are building similar products, trying to separate out the signal from the noise, and hopefully some of you in here are online or are working to do that too, because I think it's such a critical problem.

我和许多正在生产类似产品的人谈过，他们试图将信号与噪音分开，希望你们中的一些人也在网上，或者也在努力做到这一点，因为我认为这是一个非常关键的问题。

Turns out, very hard problem for a variety of reasons, but I think it's critical that someone solve it.

结果是，由于各种各样的原因，非常困难的问题，但我认为这是至关重要的，有人解决它。

\- Maybe for the benefit of these folks, never fear, we will talk about crypto, talk a little bit, if you would, about the process of starting the company. You left school to do it, and the winding down, like what happened? And maybe if there's some lessons learned in there from that experience.

\-也许为了这些人的利益，永远不要害怕，我们将讨论密码问题，如果你愿意的话，我们将讨论一些关于创建公司的过程。你离开学校去做这件事，然后就像发生的那样结束了? 如果从那次经历中有什么教训的话。

\- Yeah, absolutely, so the starting was really, it always is kind of the best part. When you have this germ of an idea and you're trying to turn it into something, and so we started, Tucker and I met and started talking, we were introduced by a mutual friend named Adam while I was still in school, and we started talking about this concept that there's this crazy noise level in the discourse today, especially around politics and other topics, can we separate that out? We had a lot of different ideas around how to do it and iterate it through a million different things.

\-是的，当然，所以开始是真的，它总是最好的部分。当你有了这个想法，你试图把它变成某种东西，所以我们开始，Tucker和我相遇，并开始交谈，我们是由一个共同的朋友Adam介绍，当我还在上学的时候，我们开始讨论这个概念，今天的讨论中有一个疯狂的噪音水平，特别是围绕着政治和其他话题，我们能分开吗? 我们有很多不同的想法，围绕着如何做到这一点，并迭代通过百万不同的事情。

And ultimately, he was working at that time a great job, I was in school, we were looking at it, as I'm sure many people are saying, this is a big leap to take to go from very comfortable situations, I had a couple years left of school, he was, again, doing great at work, to make this leap.

最后，他当时在工作，我在学校，我们在看着它，我相信很多人都说，这是一个很大的飞跃，从非常舒适的情况下，我还有几年的时间在学校，他又一次，在工作中做得很好，实现了这一飞跃。

And so we said, alright, we got to a place where nine months in of kind of casual discussions, 'cause we were both working and learning, we said we think we know what we want to do here，

所以我们说，好吧，我们去了一个有九个月时间的非正式讨论的地方，因为我们都在工作和学习，我们说我们知道我们想要在这里做什么，

\- And the timing was，

\-时间是，

\- The timing was great. We're looking at this, this is right before summer 2014. So we know we've got some lead time up into the elections to build stuff, and then launch into the election cycle. We thought we knew what we wanted to build, and so we said, alright, well, we need to get some validation for this before we get going, which was just the state of mind that we were in.

\-时机很好。我们在看这个，就在2014年夏季之前。因此，我们知道，我们已经有了一些准备时间进入选举，建设的东西，然后启动进入选举周期。我们认为我们知道我们想要构建什么，所以我们说，好吧，在我们开始之前，我们需要对此进行一些验证，这就是我们当时的心态。

I don't think this is always true for entrepreneurs by any means, but our state was we're both in great positions, this is gonna be really hard, let's get some validation. So we went out and said we're gonna raise some money, and if we can successfully raise that money, let's go and do it.

我不认为这对企业家来说总是正确的，但是我们的状态是我们都处于很好的位置，这将是非常困难的，让我们来验证一下。所以我们出去说，我们要筹集一些钱，如果我们能成功地筹集到这些钱，我们就去做吧。

The commitment kind of was that if we could do that before the summer, I would go obviously over my summer and work on it full-time and then beyond, and he would leave the job and go and we'd do it together.

我的承诺是，如果我们能在夏季之前做到这一点，我会在整个夏季全职工作，然后在更远的时间工作，然后他会离开工作，去，我们会一起做这件事。

And so were able to put together that money and get that validation and start building.

所以他们能把钱凑到一起，得到认可，然后开始建设。

\- Did you raise from angels then?

\-那你是从天使那里养大的吗?

\- Yeah, almost entirely from angels, yeah.

\-是的，几乎全是天使的，是的。

And we had an amazing set of investors. Lesson learned, and thankfully we didn't learn it in the negative way, having great investors is such a boon throughout the business when things are going well and when things are going poorly, and we'll get to the wind down, but even that part, having an amazing set of investors that were aligned with us, cared about us as people, and were supportive of what we were doing was so critical at that point.

我们有一批惊人的投资者。值得庆幸的是，我们并没有以消极的方式学到这一点，拥有伟大的投资者对整个公司来说都是一种恩惠，当事情进展顺利，情况不佳的时候，我们就会走到尽头，但即使是这样，拥有一群惊人的投资者，他们与我们站在一起，关心我们，关心我们，支持我们所做的事情，在这一点上是如此重要的。“。”(注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注)))

And really digging in on what their motivations were was really important. See, we raised from a lot of people, we had, I forget the exact number now, but something like 44 investors in our seed round or something like that.

真正深入了解他们的动机是什么非常重要。你看，我们从很多人身上，我们曾经，我现在忘记了确切的数字，但是在我们的种子期，大约有44个投资者，或者类似的东西。

\- Did you ever think that maybe that was too many?

\-你有没有想过那可能太多了?

\- Yes and no.

\-是和不是。

The only time I ever genuinely thought that，

唯一一次我真的认为，

\- 'Cause you never really wanna turn down money, right?

\-因为你从来不想拒绝金钱，对吗?

\- The only time I genuinely thought that was too many was when I was dealing with meeting all of them to sign things. But generally, again, it goes back to the quality of the investors.

\--唯一一次我真的觉得太多了，是在我要和他们所有人见面的时候。但总的来说，它又回到了投资者的素质。

They were supportive and not annoying and never nagged us.

他们支持我们，不烦我们，从不唠叨我们。

And we sent out our monthly updates, made sure they were informed and it was never a problem, it was just sending out 44 Docusigns is a lot of Docusigns to send out, but outside of that it was fine.

我们每月发送一次更新，确保他们得到了信息，这并不是问题，它只是发送了44个文件标志是很多文件标志发送出去，但除此之外，它是好的。

\- You can imagine one issue with 40, or 50, or 60 investors is that even if you really try to only get high-quality investors, the probability that one or two of those are difficult gets pretty high.

\--你可以想象一个关于40，或者50，或者60个投资者的问题是，即使你真的试图只得到高质量的投资者，其中一个或两个很难获得高质量投资者的概率也会很高。

\- Absolutely, and of course, even within that set of 44, there was a spectrum of people ranging from absolutely perfect to slightly less perfect. But on the whole, it was a really great set, and we were fortunate to be supported by them.

\-当然，即使在这44人的群体中，也有一系列的人，从绝对完美到略不完美不等。但总的来说，这是一个非常伟大的团队，我们很幸运能得到他们的支持。

And so we ended up doing that, and the short story on the company is we built for about a year, and then we raised the last part of that round, it was all one big round, but raised the last part of that round from Spark Capital, who were amazing investors, highly recommend working with them, and they kind of completed our institutional seed round.

因此，我们最终做到了这一点，公司的小故事是我们建立了大约一年，然后我们提高了最后一轮，这都是一个大的回合，但提高了最后一轮，从火花资本，谁是惊人的投资者，强烈建议与他们合作，他们差不多完成了我们的机构种子轮。

And then we launched the product, and ran it for a couple years, and ultimately wound it down last summer, yeah, 2017, mid-2017, and I think from a product perspective--

然后我们推出了该产品，并运行了几年，最终在去年夏天，是的，2017年年中，我认为从产品的角度来看--

\- Just before you get there, so you went all the way through the 2016 presidential cycle, did you guys have any insight more than the rest of us about what was going to happen in November 2016 based on the experts' discussions that were taking place?

\-就在你们到达那里之前，所以你们一直走到2016年总统任期的最后一站，你们对2016年11月将会发生的事情有没有比我们其他人更深刻的理解，基于专家们正在进行的讨论?

\- There's things I can say and things I can't say. We were talking to a lot of smart people，

\-有些事我可以说，有些事我不能说。我们在和很多聪明人说话，

\- Say the things you can't say, no.

\-说那些你不能说的，不。

\- That's a good one. Yeah, there's a lot of--

\-那是个好主意。是的，有很多--

\- [Female] That's exactly what happened.

\-(女性)这正是发生的事情。

\- That was exactly what happened.

\-事情就是这样的。

\- [Female] Unexpected results.

意外结果。

\- There's a lot of smart people out there, and this ties into what Sidewire was able to do, but also who we were talking to. We got this amazing set of experts on the platform engaging like crazy, about 1，000 people, senators, presidential candidates, reporters, analysts, staffers, like all the people you would want to have talking, the really smart voices, the smart commentators, having these amazing discussions, going back and forth, firing back and forth, being entertaining. We felt like that side, 'cause it was a marketplace, right, You had supply of content and demand of content, no one was paying, but supply and demand. We crushed the supply, and just no matter what we did we couldn't get people to pay attention to it, which we thought was so interesting. So our thesis going in, and I think a lot of the time startups are about having a thesis and testing it, but a thesis we felt really strongly about, it wasn't so far as build it and they will come, but we thought, this is a marketplace, a two-sided marketplace, if we can get the supply, if we can get smart people to have smart conversations about the news of the day, then we will be able to get people that show up to stick around and keep engaging with those conversations and reading them. No matter what we did, and there's no way to know what the issue was, we could not get people to come and stick around. People would show up and read one conversation, and then would not come back, and I think, at the end of the day, what we felt like was in that space it's hard to get people to care about the smart conversations. People say that's what they're looking for, and it might not actually be what drives them and what they actually want.

\-外面有很多聪明人，这关系到侧线能做什么，也关系到我们在和谁说话。我们有这样一批惊人的专家站在平台上，像疯狂的，大约1000人，参议员，总统候选人，记者，分析师，工作人员，就像所有你想要的人一样，真正聪明的声音，聪明的评论员，进行这些惊人的讨论，来回地讨论，来回地射击，娱乐。我们感觉就像那一边，因为它是一个市场，对，你有内容和内容的需求，没有人付钱，而是供给和需求。我们压垮了供应，不管我们做什么，我们都无法让人们注意到它，我们认为它很有趣。因此，我们的论文进入，我认为很多时候，初创公司都是关于有一个论文并对其进行测试，但是一个我们非常感兴趣的论文，它并不是建立的那么远，而且它们也会到来，但是我们认为，这是一个市场，一个双向市场，如果我们能得到供应，如果我们能让聪明的人就当天的新闻进行聪明的对话，那么我们将能够让那些人继续参与，并且坚持下去。不管我们做了什么，也没有办法知道是什么问题，我们不能让人来，留在附近。人们会出现，读到一个对话，然后不会再回来，我认为，最终，我们的感觉是，在那个空间，很难让人们关心聪明的对话。人们说这是他们想要的，但实际上并不是驱动他们的因素，也不是他们真正想要的。

\- They want 140 or 280 characters of sensational tweets.

\-他们想要140或280字的耸人听闻的推特。

\- I hope that that's not true, and I hope that we had issues with the product that were deeper than that, or something like that, that caused it to not be effective in retaining users, but at the end of the day, we had a really tough time even given just a stream of crazy, high-quality content from the best people in the world on these topics.

\-我希望这不是真的，我希望我们的产品有更深层次的问题，或者类似的问题，导致它不能有效地留住用户，但最终，即使是世界上最优秀的人在这些问题上提供了一系列疯狂，高质量的内容，我们也面临着非常艰难的时刻。

Tough to get those people to stick around.

很难让那些人留下来。

\- Okay, so this is a tough question for any startup to answer, which is at some point you decided it wasn't an issue of tweaks, it wasn't an issue of being able to find product market fit, that you could pivot 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 180 degrees, it wasn't gonna happen, and you wound the company down, how did you guys come to that decision?

\-好吧，这对任何初创公司来说都是一个很难回答的问题，在某种程度上，你认为这不是一个调整的问题，也不是一个能够找到产品市场合适度的问题，你可以以10度，20度，180度为支点，这是不会发生的，你让公司破产的，你们是怎么做出这个决定的?

\- Yeah, so we did try a couple other related, but more than 10- or 20-degree tweaks, but related topics, a subscription service that we tried for a little bit, and pitched some enterprise-related things. Ultimately we decided that what we were looking at, the possibilities we were looking at, even if they succeeded couldn't be venture-scale businesses that we needed to be betting on.

\-是的，所以我们尝试了一些其他相关的，但超过10或20度的调整，但相关的主题，一个我们尝试了一点点的订阅服务，并提出了一些与企业相关的东西。最终，我们决定，我们所看到的，我们所看到的可能性，即使他们成功了，不可能是风险规模的业务，我们需要打赌。

These are conversations we had with our investors, super honest, transparent conversations with them, with our team, with each other, and we said, alright, well, our core business that we've envisioned and been working on for two, three years, don't think that one's gonna work, at least without some crazy change at how people are thinking, or us having some insane insight of fixing something's that terribly broken.

这些是我们与投资者的对话，非常诚实，透明的对话，我们与团队的对话，以及彼此的对话，我们说，好吧，好吧，我们的核心业务，我们已经设想和工作了两，三年，不要认为一个人会工作，至少没有一些疯狂的改变，人们是怎么想的，或者我们有一些疯狂的洞察力，去修复那些严重破坏的东西。

These other businesses we're looking at, other business lines, there's a possibility, but these aren't the type of returns that we're looking for, our investors are looking for when we started this business.

我们所关注的其他业务，其他业务线，都有可能，但这些不是我们所寻找的回报类型，我们的投资者是在寻找当我们开始这一业务。

And so at that point we said, alright, instead of trying to keep this thing on life support, let's wind it down and move to our next thing and keep building from there.

所以在这一点上，我们说，好吧，不要试图让这个东西靠生命维持，让我们放下它，移动到我们的下一个东西，并继续建设从那里。

And it was a decision that everyone was incredibly supportive of, again, this goes right back to the good investor thing.

这是一个每个人都难以置信地支持的决定，再一次，这又回到了良好的投资者的事情。

It is easy for people to give you a lot of grief when you make a decision like that, but we were incredibly fortunate to have an amazing set of investors that supported us in that.

当你做出这样的决定时，人们很容易给你很多悲伤，但我们非常幸运，有一批惊人的投资者在这方面支持我们。

\- Okay, last question on Sidewire. Do you think, if you could've persuaded President Trump to call you fake news, you might've been able to survive?

\-好的，侧线上的最后一个问题。你认为，如果你能说服特朗普总统说你是假消息，你可能还活着吗?

\- We've talked about that a lot.

\-我们已经谈过很多次了。

I don't think so.

我不这么认为。

It's so bizarre, we could talk for hours about this, people would show up and engage, and then they'd just kind of, like, disappear.

这太奇怪了，我们可以聊上几个小时，人们就会出现并参与进来，然后他们就会，就像，消失了一样。

They'd be like, this just doesn't do it for me.

他们会说，这不是为了我。

And we'd talk to people, and they'd say, yeah, oh it's great, the content's really good, I would never go and read a ton there, really pick it up. You know, there's not a lot of people out there that pick up the New York Times every day and read it cover to cover, and that's effectively the same type of person that we were looking for, someone that cared about that level of discourse.

我们会和人们交谈，他们会说，是的，太棒了，内容真的很好，我绝不会去那里看太多的书，真的捡起来。你知道吗，没有多少人每天都去看“纽约时报”的封面报道，实际上，这就是我们要找的那种人，一个关心这个层次的话题的人。

\- You have to somehow make it a habit.

\-你必须让它成为一种习惯。

This is true for any startup. You have to somehow create enough value so that you get integrated into people's lives, and it's hard to do that with news.

这对于任何初创公司都是正确的。你必须以某种方式创造足够的价值，这样你就能融入到人们的生活中去，而且很难通过新闻来做到这一点。

\- And I do think, you alluded to people want 140 or 280 characters of crazy stuff. Sure, there's an element of that that is people want the crazy things that just spew up, fake news this, fake news that, whatever it is. But the other piece of that is that it's easiest to create a habit with something that's bite-sized.

\-我确实认为，你暗示人们想要140或280字的疯狂的东西。当然，这其中有一个因素，那就是人们想要那些疯狂的东西，这些东西，假的新闻，假的新闻，不管是什么。但另一件事是，用一口大小的东西来养成一个习惯是最容易的。

And what we were asking people to do was read a real conversation, it was kind of like an iMessage format, like people were going back and forth and having these back-and-forth conversations.

我们要求人们去做的是读一篇真正的对话，它有点像一种信息格式，就像人们来回的交谈。

That's not bite-size, takes you a few minutes to read, if not longer, to read these really engaging ones, and they're smart people saying smart things, you gotta think about what they're saying.

这不是一口大小，你需要几分钟阅读，如果不是更长的时间，阅读这些真正吸引人的，他们是聪明的人说聪明的事情，你必须考虑他们说什么。

And jumping from not engaging with a service to engaging with a long conversation you have to read is a big jump to make.

从不参与服务到参与长时间的谈话，你必须阅读，这是一个很大的飞跃。

And so I think, yeah, to your point, building habits is so crucial and habits are easiest started with something very small that might eventually expand to something big, and think about how much time many people spend on Facebook, but it often starts with something really small there to build that habit. Facebook has great things around you sign up, connect with 10 friends, they've got these numbers of you need to do this, you need to do that.

所以我想，是的，对你来说，养成习惯是如此的重要，而习惯是最简单的，从一个很小的东西开始，这个东西可能最终会扩展到很大的东西，想想有多少人在Facebook上花了很多时间，但它通常是从一个很小的东西开始，来建立这个习惯。Facebook有很多很棒的东西在你身边注册，和10个朋友联系，他们有很多你需要做的事情，你需要做的事情。

It's all easy, it's all limited time, and then the habit starts to get ingrained and you can build it out bigger from there.

这一切都很简单，时间都很有限，然后习惯开始根深蒂固，你可以从那里把它建得更大。

\- Okay, so let's, let's transition to talk about Andy Bromberg phase 2.5, where you went back a little bit to, I wouldn't say your crypto roots, but back to some of the work you'd been doing earlier at Stanford, and got involved with, I guess, Naval and AngelList and eventually CoinList, how did that transpire?

\-好吧，让我们来讨论一下Andy Bromberg的2.5阶段，在那里你稍微回到了，我不会说你的密码根，但是回到你在斯坦福之前的一些工作，我想，是海军和天使列表，最后是CoinList，是怎么发生的呢?

\- Yeah, so even to take a step further back than that, when I left school in 2014, I was crazy interested in crypto, I was spending a ton of time on it with the Stanford Bitcoin Group and my friends and people in the industry, and the reason I didn't feel comfortable doing anything in crypto at that time was because of a secular issue for me which was, at that point in 2014, I couldn't make a decision, I thought it was a coin flip, whether or not there was gonna be one cryptocurrency forever, Bitcoin was gonna be it and that was gonna be the end of it, or if there were gonna be a ton of cryptocurrencies out there.

\-是的, 所以即使再往后退一步, 当我在2014年离开学校时, 我对密码很感兴趣, 我花了大量的时间和斯坦福比特币集团以及我的朋友们和业界人士在一起，当时我不愿意在密码方面做任何事情的原因是因为一个长期的问题，那就是，在2014年的那个时候，我无法做出决定，我认为这是一个硬币翻转，是否会永远有一种密码，比特币将会是它，如果它的货币将会是它的终结，或者密码将会是它的终结。

And I was looking at it and saying startups, high failure rate already, do I wanna add a 50% coin flip to that, because anything I could think of betting on relied on one of those two outcomes.

我看着它说，初创公司的失败率已经很高了，我是否想给它加一个50%的硬币翻转，因为任何我能想到的打赌都依赖于这两种结果之一。

And I said I don't want to add 50% more to an already high attrition rate, so I'm gonna not do this for now. By the time it came back, end of last, or middle of last--

我说我不想再给已经很高的减员率再增加50%，所以现在我不会再这么做了。当它回来的时候，末了，或末了，或末了，或末了，或末了，或末了--

\- Usually the attrition's rate so high that 50% hardly makes a difference.

\-通常情况下，损耗率很高，50%几乎没有什么区别。

\- That's another way to look at it. Double your chance of failure is not a bet I want to take often. 2017, I'm looking at it and saying, I'm now a believer, there's going to be at least more than one, who knows how many, successful cryptocurrencies in the long run, we can talk more about what that number might be, and how we should think about that.

\-那是另一种看待它的方式。我不想经常赌你失败的几率翻倍。2017年，我看着它，说，我现在是一个信徒，至少会有一个以上的人，谁知道有多少，从长远来看，成功的密码货币，我们可以更多地讨论这个数字可能是什么，以及我们应该如何看待这个数字。

I feel comfortable going back into this space now.

现在回到这个地方我感到很自在。

And the story with CoinList is that, CoinList was started about a year ago, just over a year ago, we just celebrated our internal one-year anniversary, and it was created as a collaboration between Protocol Labs, proud Y Combinator company, and AngelList to run Protocol Labs token sale for their product Filecoin, for their token Filecoin.

COINLIST的故事是，COINLIST大约在一年前就开始了，就在一年前，我们刚刚庆祝了我们的内部一周年纪念日，它是由ProtocolLabs，自豪的Y Combinator Company和AngelList共同创建的，以运行ProtocolLabs Token Sales for Product FileCin，for Token FileCoin。

\- And I think that you have to unpack that a little bit.

\-我想你得把它拆开一点。

I was trying to think about how, hopefully a lot of the people here and out there understand cryptocurrencies, and there's lots and lots and lots and lots that's been written and said about them, but maybe we can sort of very briefly outline what a cryptocurrency is, what a token sale is, what a token is, and why you might be selling them.

我在想，希望这里和外面的很多人都能理解密码，而且已经有很多很多很多很多很多关于密码的文章，但是也许我们可以简单地描述一下什么是密码，什么是象征性交易，什么是象征性交易，以及为什么要出售密码。

\- Yeah, yeah, three more hours everyone? I think at its core a token is a scarce digital asset, we'll talk more about what each of these things mean, a scarce digital asset that represents ownership, most commonly of a token network. So the idea here is that when you launch a token network, it goes out and no one then controls it. So Bitcoin, as a lot of you know, was created by this pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, I don't know if that's a he, or a she, or a single person, or a group of people, no one knows who Satoshi is.

\-是的，是的，还有三个小时? 我认为，令牌的核心是一种稀缺的数字资产，我们将更多地讨论这些东西的每一个含义，一种稀缺的数字资产，它代表所有权，最常见的是令牌网络。因此这里的想法是，当您启动一个令牌网络时，它会退出，然后没有人控制它。所以比特币，你们很多人都知道，是用这个化名中本聪创建的，我不知道是他，还是她，还是一个人，还是一群人，没有人知道他是谁。

And somehow--

不知何故--

\- Which is weird, right? This really important thing that's made and lost fortunes for people, and maybe will be the basis of the future economy, no one knows where it came from. Weird, right?

\-这很奇怪，对吧? 这对人们来说是一件非常重要的事情，可能会成为未来经济的基础，没有人知道它从何而来。很奇怪，对吧?

\- Yeah, like really let that settle, it's worth like $100 billion right now, the total market cap of Bitcoin, and no one knows who made it.

\-是的，就像真的让它解决了一样，现在它的价值大约是1000亿美元，比特币的总市值，而且没有人知道是谁做的。

And in fact, Satoshi has some large number of tokens socked away in a wallet somewhere that has never been used. We have billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, we have no idea who has that, literally no idea.

事实上，Satoshi在一个从未使用过的钱包里藏了大量的代币。我们有价值数十亿美元的比特币，我们不知道谁有，真的不知道。

\- If anyone has it.

\-如果有人有的话。

\- If anyone, right.

\-如果有人，对。

That is kind of the ultimate ideal how to think about it, that that's possible. You can launch this token network and have it go out into the world and have nobody control it, and it just kind of happens.

这是一种终极理想，如何思考，这是可能的。您可以启动这个令牌网络，让它走出这个世界，没有人控制它，它就这样发生了。

And so what these companies are now doing when they launch these new tokens, like Protocol Labs launching Filecoin, their intention is to build a network. Got a lot of code to write, they've gotta build this thing, and they're gonna put it out there into the world, and they're of course gonna continue to support it as core developers of the product and improve the network, but they won't actually have control over it.

因此，当这些公司发布这些新的标记时，就像ProtocolLabs发布filecoin一样，他们的目的是建立一个网络。有很多代码要写，他们必须构建这个东西，他们将把它发布到世界上，当然，他们将继续作为产品的核心开发人员支持它，并改进网络，但是他们实际上不会控制它。

The users, whoever those users may be and whatever categories they may fit into for that specific network, are the ones that have control over that network.

用户，不管这些用户是谁，也不管他们适合于哪个特定的网络，都是那些对该网络有控制权的用户。

\- Well, talk about what Protocol Labs was doing.

\-好吧，说说礼宾实验室在做什么。

The token that Protocol Labs, this first token that CoinList was working on was not, you could say Bitcoin is a value in and of itself, it's like a new currency, but the token for Protocol Labs was inextricably linked to a different value that was being delivered to consumers, right?

协议实验室的第一个令牌，coinlist的第一个令牌，并不是，你可以说比特币本身就是一个值，它就像一种新的货币，但是协议实验室的令牌与传递给消费者的另一个不同的价值有着千丝万缕的联系，对吗?

\- Yeah, yeah, we should talk about that. One other thing I wanna mention just on tokens in general, and this analogy's a little bit abused, but there's one reason I use it, I would think of tokens and blockchain technology, which powers many tokens, like the internet for one really core reason.

\-是的，是的，我们应该谈谈。还有一件事，我想说的只是一般的代币，这个比喻有点被滥用了，但有一个原因，我使用它，我会想到代币和块链技术，它支持许多代币，就像互联网一样，有一个真正的核心原因。

If I asked you, hey Jeff, I've got a website, and here's a bunch of data about it, how do you value it? It's impossible to answer that question, because if that website is NYTimes.com, or Amazon.com. Or Google.com, or Facebook.com, those are all totally different businesses.

如果我问你，嘿，杰夫，我有一个网站，这里有一大堆关于它的数据，你怎么评价它? 要回答这个问题是不可能的，因为如果这个网站是Nytimes.com或Amazon.com的话。或者Google.com，或者FaceBook.com，这些都是完全不同的业务。

They are all built on the internet, sure, but you look at each of their revenues, they've got different multiples，, how do you think about how these businesses are built. Saying how do you value a website is kind of a meaningless question, you have to know much more about the specific use case and how it's built, and in the same way, I think there's a lot of discussion, I get the question a ton from people, okay, but how do we value these tokens? And to me, that's a little bit of an impossible question because tokens are built on different premises and have different applications, and you can break them down into categories and think about how to value each of those categories, in the same way you could say, well how do we value a social networking website, or how do we value a news website, or how do we value a CPG website? But you have to think about those categories, and the idea of a token or blockchain technology is really just this kind of meta concept that allows for other things to be built on top of it.

当然，它们都是建立在互联网上的，但是你看着它们的每一个收入，它们都有不同的倍数，你如何看待这些业务是如何建立起来的。说你如何评价一个网站是一个没有意义的问题，你必须更多地了解具体的用例和它是如何构建的，同样，我认为有很多讨论，我从人们那里得到了很多问题，好吗，但是我们如何评价这些标记呢? 对我来说，这是一个不太可能的问题，因为令牌是基于不同的前提和不同的应用程序，您可以将它们细分为不同的类别，并考虑如何评价每一个类别，就像您可以说，我们如何评价一个社交网站，或者我们如何评价一个新闻网站，或者我们如何评价一个CPG网站一样。但是，您必须考虑这些类别，而令牌或块链技术的概念实际上就是这种元概念，它允许在其之上构建其他东西。

And one more piece of that analogy would be that I'd draw a similarity between the internet is infrastructure for exchanging and transacting information, it moves information around, tokens and token networks are infrastructure for transacting or exchanging value. So for the first time we can actually kind of programmatically exchange value in this core way.

还有一个类似的例子，我认为Internet是交换和处理信息的基础设施，它移动信息，令牌和令牌网络是交易或交换价值的基础设施。因此，我们第一次可以以这种核心方式以编程方式交换值。

\- One of the strange things about the whole conversation, so here's how I would answer your question about how to value a website.

\--整场对话中的一件奇怪的事情，所以我将如何回答你关于网站价值的问题。

And it actually is the way people have always valued things, which is, well, I would say, tell me about the cash flows that that website will generate over time, and then historically we've figured out ways to value those things using things like net present value and all these economic concepts. But tokens seem somehow different, because they don't necessarily seem to be tied to cash flows.

事实上，这就是人们一直重视事物的方式，我想说的是，告诉我这个网站随着时间的推移将产生的现金流，从历史上看，我们已经想出了利用净现值和所有这些经济概念来评估这些事物价值的方法。但代币似乎有些不同，因为它们并不一定与现金流挂钩。

\- Yeah, so let's talk about Filecoin like you were saying, just as an example, and this is again just one example of many, and one of many categories.

\-是的，让我们就像你所说的那样来讨论Filecoin，就作为一个例子，这也只是多个例子中的一个，也是多个类别中的一个。

I'll give kind of a quick description of Filecoin and how it works, and we can go into it more in the Q&A. So Filecoin is a token that allows for the exchange of files, storage of files.

我将对filecoin和它的工作原理做一个简单的描述，我们可以在Q&A中更深入地研究它。所以FileCin是一个令牌，它允许文件的交换，文件的存储。

It's aiming to solve this problem of how do you store files, and transact for that, and build a market for storing files.

它的目的是解决如何存储文件的问题，并对其进行处理，从而建立一个存储文件的市场。

And so if you think about the simplest solution to how would one build a business to solve that problem, the simplest solution probably looks something like Amazon S3.

因此，如果您考虑最简单的解决方案，如何建立一个企业来解决这个问题，那么最简单的解决方案可能类似于AmazonS3。

If Jeff has files that he wants to store, and I'm saying I'm gonna start a business that helps him store these files, I'm probably gonna buy a bunch of servers, and Jeff's gonna hand me files, I'm gonna put them on the servers, when he asks for them back, I'm gonna hand them back, and he's gonna pay me. So that works, big businesses today are built like that, but it has a few problems. So, one, you've got someone that's taking fees, I'm charging on top of the storage costs for him to be able to do this, but there's also issues of things like censorship. So I now have access to his files, I can censor them, I can look at them, I can do whatever I want to them, and you're relying on a single third party not to mess anything up. So I could corrupt the files, I might have downtime and not be able to return them.

如果Jeff有他想要存储的文件，我说我要开一家公司来帮他存储这些文件，我可能会买一堆服务器，Jeff会把它们交给我，我会把它们放在服务器上，当他要我把它们还回去的时候，我会把它们还给他，然后他会付我钱。所以这是可行的，今天的大企业是这样建立的，但它有一些问题。所以，一个，你有一个收取费用的人，我要在他的存储成本之外收费，他才能做到这一点，但也有审查制度之类的问题。所以我现在可以访问他的文件，我可以审查他们，我可以看他们，我可以做任何我想要他们，而你是依靠一个单一的第三方不搞砸任何事情。因此，我可能会破坏文件，我可能有停机时间，不能返回他们。

And so you start to say, well, is there a better solution than this? And the first version of a better solution I think looks a lot like the Airbnb of file storage, where you'd say, alright, well instead, there's a whole bunch of people out there who have extra storage space in their computers，

所以你开始说，有比这个更好的解决方案吗? 我认为更好的解决方案的第一个版本看起来很像文件存储的airbnb，在那里你会说，好吧，相反，有一大群人在他们的计算机上有额外的存储空间，

\- Yeah, raise your hand if you have extra storage space on your computer, seriously, raise your hand, come on, all of you. You all have extra space, no? Your computers are full?

\-是的，如果你的电脑有多余的存储空间，举起你的手，真的，举起你的手，加油，你们所有人。你们都有多余的空间，不是吗? 你的电脑满了?

\- Let's do it, we're pivoting, Airbnb for files.

\-让我们来吧，我们在旋转，在空中搜索文件。

I would say maybe, alright, well now, Jeff, hand me your files, I'm gonna find someone out here, I'm connected to all of you, I've got software on your computers, I'm gonna put the files on your computer, and then when Jeff wants them back, I'll ask for them back, I'll take 'em, I'll give 'em to him, he'll pay me, I'll pay you, I'll pay me.

我会说，好吧，杰夫，现在把你的文件递给我，我会在这里找到一个人，我和你们所有人都有联系，我在你们的计算机上有软件，我会把文件放在你们的计算机上，然后当杰夫想要回它们时，我会要求它们，我会把它们拿回来，我会把它们给他，他会给我，我会付我，我会付我的钱。

\- Yeah, so these people, the few people who raised their hands here will rent, like Airbnb, they'll rent a piece of their storage that they're not using to the network.

\-是的，所以这些人，在这里举起手的几个人会租，就像Airbnb一样，他们会租一个他们不使用网络的存储区。

\- So that's a good solution, but it doesn't solve all the problems we talked about.

\--这是一个很好的解决办法，但它并不能解决我们所讨论的所有问题。

It does, first of all, make it a little bit cheaper most likely, because this is kind of latent storage space.

首先，它使它更便宜，因为这是一种潜在的存储空间。

It's cheaper then buying new servers, but still, there's a middleman, right, there's an intermediary, me, who could go down, I could have downtime, I could censor the files, again, I could look at them, so you're still trusting someone. So Filecoin, Protocol Labs building Filecoin and the underlying thing called IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, which is the coolest name for a file system ever, said, is there a way to solve this? Can we connect Jeff directly to people out here who have extra storage space with no trusted intermediary? That's the problem that Filecoin is trying to solve.

买新服务器比买新服务器便宜，但还是有一个中间人，对，有一个中间人，我，可以下去，我可以停工，我可以审查文件，我可以再看一次，所以你仍然信任某人。因此，Filecoin，协议实验室，构建Filecoin和基础的称为IPFS的东西，星际文件系统，这是有史以来最酷的文件系统的名称，说，有没有一种方法来解决这个问题? 我们能不能直接把Jeff和那些在这里有额外存储空间而没有可信中介的人联系起来? 这就是Filecoin想要解决的问题。

They build this token for a few reasons. One, Filecoin is used as the mechanism of payment. So Jeff pays you to store his files with Filecoin. But there's a couple interesting problems we have to solve. First of all, what if one of you does something bad? You corrupt his files, you lose them, you don't return them fast enough, so the first step of the solution is to make each of you that is storing his files for him already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space, you already have to have Filecoin, and you do what's called staking. You take those tokens and you put them up effectively in escrow, and you say, here, I'm putting my own tokens up, I'm putting something at stake and if I get caught doing something wrong, if I don't return his files fast enough, if I don't return them at all, then I lose my tokens. So you are disincentivized from doing something bad to Jeff's files.

他们建造这个标记有几个原因。一是利用Filecoin作为支付机制。所以Jeff付钱让你用FileCin存储他的文件。但是我们有几个有趣的问题要解决。首先，如果你们中有人做了坏事怎么办? 您损坏了他的文件，丢失了它们，您没有足够快地返回它们，因此解决方案的第一步是让为他存储文件的每个人都有一个filecoin。因此，如果您有额外的存储空间，那么您已经必须有filecoin，并执行所谓的staking操作。你拿着这些代币，然后有效地把它们放入代管，你说，在这里，我把我自己的代币放上去，我把一些东西放在危险中，如果我做错了什么，如果我没有足够快地归还他的文件，如果我根本没有归还，那么我就丢失了我的代币。所以你不鼓励对杰夫的文件做坏事。

That's interesting step number one.

有趣的第一步。

Then you're on to the second problem, which is who's the judge of that? If we're not trusting a central intermediary, how do we know if you are not storing the files well, or corrupting them, or how do we know if you're not returning them fast enough? And that's where step two of this really interesting solution comes into play, which is that there's a massive network outside of this room, thousands of people of what they call verifiers.

那么你要讨论的是第二个问题，谁是这个问题的评判者? 如果我们不信任一个中央中介，我们如何知道您是否存储了这些文件，或者损坏了这些文件，或者我们如何知道您返回它们的速度不够快? 这就是这个非常有趣的解决方案的第二步，这就是在这个房间之外有一个庞大的网络，成千上万的人，他们称之为验证者。

And I'm gonna oversimplify what they do a little bit, because they have this crazy thing called proof of space-time, over the top, we could talk for hours about it, but a simple solution for how to make sure that each of you is storing his files correctly is that 1，000 different people come to Jeff and they each say to Jeff, hey Jeff, what's the 46th letter of your file, what's the 127th letter of your file, what's the 196th letter of your file? And Jeff says, it's J, A, and K.

我要把他们做的事情简化一点，因为他们有一个疯狂的东西，叫做时空证明，我们可以讨论几个小时，但是一个简单的解决方法，确保你们每个人都能正确地存储他的文件，那就是1000个不同的人来找杰夫，他们每个人都对杰夫说，嘿，杰夫，你的文件的第46个字母是什么，你的文件的第127个字母是什么，你的第196个字母是什么? 杰夫说，这是J，A和K。

And then they go to each person that's storing the files and they ask that exact same question.

然后，他们去找每个存储文件的人，他们会问一个完全相同的问题。

That person who asked about the 47th letter says, hey, what's the 47th letter of the file you're storing? You answer that's J, and they'd check, A, K, and now all of a sudden, when enough verifiers do that we can say with confidence that the person storing the files for Jeff is doing so correctly.

那个问到第47个字母的人说，嘿，你存储的文件的第47个字母是什么? 你回答是J，他们会检查，A，K，现在突然，当有足够多的验证者这样做，我们可以放心地说，为Jeff存储文件的人是正确的。

And at that point, the network says, great job everyone, Jeff pays you for storing his files, you get your staked tokens back, Jeff gets his files if he wants them, and the verifiers get rewarded by effectively mining, new tokens are minted by the network and given to the verifiers for doing that work.

在这一点上，网络说，每个人都做得很好，Jeff支付你存储他的文件的费用，如果Jeff想要的话，你拿回你的标记标记，Jeff得到他的文件，验证者得到的回报是有效的挖掘，新的标记是由网络铸造的，并交给验证者来完成这项工作。

\- Which makes the supply of coins expand over time.

\-这使得硬币的供应量随着时间的推移而增加。

\- Exactly, and so then you have this market where each of these three parties, the person with the files, the person with the storage space and these verifiers are all incentivized to do the right thing, disincentivized from doing the wrong thing, and there is no trusted intermediary, and you avoid all those problems I cited with the S3 example at the beginning.

\-正是这样，你就有了这样一个市场:这三个方面的每个人，拥有文件的人，拥有存储空间的人和这些验证者都被激励去做正确的事情，不被激励去做错误的事情，而且没有可信的中间人，你就可以避免我最初用S3示例提到的所有问题。

That really gets to the core of what this all is, and I'll stop rambling in a second here, but blockchains and tokens are about incentive alignment.

这真的触及到了这一切的核心，我会停止在这里漫无边际，但封锁链和标志是关于激励一致。

It's about this question of how can you build a trustless system, a system where no party has to trust any other party in a system without anyone being involved in managing that, and the way to do that is to properly incentivize everyone and build these economic systems that allow for that interaction to happen.

这是一个关于如何建立一个不信任的系统的问题，在这个系统中，任何一方都必须信任系统中的任何一方，而不需要任何人参与管理这个系统，而这样做的方法是适当地激励每个人，建立允许这种交互发生的经济系统。

\- I think that's one of the best articulations I've heard of what the blockchain-based tokens are about, incentive alignment, but they're about one more thing, isn't it true that they're also about removing, aligning the incentives of the folks in the network so that you can remove the central authority. So that you can remove Amazon in the S2 case, or the United States government, The Fed, in the Bitcoin case, right?

\-我认为这是我听说过的关于基于BlockChain的标记的最好的表述之一，但是它们是关于另一件事，不是真的吗，它们也是关于删除，使网络中的人的奖励一致，这样你就可以删除中央权威。这样你就可以在S2案中删除亚马逊，或者在比特币案中删除美国政府，美联储，对吧?

\- Right, and that's for any number of reasons, and that goes back to, it could be for pricing reasons, it could be that the middleman is charging fees that are unreasonable, it could be for censorship reasons, the middleman is censoring, it could be for fear of surveillance, it could be for any number of reasons. But ultimately the most common and effective use of these blockchain systems is to, yes, remove that middleman and make it so this trustless system can exist just between the counterparties that need to be involved in a transaction.

\-是的，那是因为很多原因，可以是因为价格原因，可以是因为中间人收取的费用不合理，可以是因为审查制度的原因，可以是因为中间人审查，可以是因为害怕被监视，可以是因为很多原因。但最终，最常见和最有效的使用这些封锁链系统是，是的，移除中间人，使它，使这种不信任的系统可以存在仅仅是双方之间需要参与交易。

\- That's kind of the ultimately democratic version of networking, right?

\-这是一种最终的民主版的网络，对吗?

\- Markets for everything, yeah.

\-所有东西的市场，是的。

\- Everyone out here in Startup School world might be asking themselves, cool, crypto, cool, tokens, what does that have to do with me? What does this have to do with startups? You and I have talked a bit about the history of investing, and we've come to this place where tokens are, in fact, an important component of how startups raise money and exist. Maybe you can talk a little bit about this evolution to where, to ICOs, initial coin offerings, and the role CoinList is playing.

\-这里的每个人都可能会问自己，酷，密码，酷，代币，这和我有什么关系? 这和初创公司有什么关系? 你和我已经谈了一些投资的历史，我们来到了这个地方，标志，事实上，一个重要的组成部分，如何筹集资金和存在的初创公司。也许你可以谈一谈这个演变，到哪里，到iCOS，首次投币式投币式，以及coinlist扮演的角色。

\- Yeah, so probably a little bit of an unusual perspective here, CoinList, we run token sales, we make money when people work with us to run their token sales, that's great.

\-是的，所以这里可能有一点不寻常的观点，Coinlist，我们经营象征性销售，当人们和我们一起经营他们的象征性销售时，我们就能赚钱，这很好。

I think today token sales are a good idea for an incredibly, incredibly, incredibly small number of companies.

我认为今天的象征性销售是一个好主意，一个难以置信，难以置信，难以置信的少数公司。

I think of the 27，000, is that right, companies in Startup School, there may be a few where it's a really good idea for a token to exist, not all 27，000 today.

我想到了27，000，对不对，创业学校的公司，也许有几家是一个很好的想法，一个象征存在，而不是所有的27，000今天。

There are cases I can make for in the future and making sense for a broader set, but today I think it's a very small number. Just to give you a data point on that. CoinList, we've existed for about a year, we've publicly worked with five token sales in the last year. We have had inbound people asking us to work with them more than 2，500 token sales.

有些情况我可以在未来，使更广泛的意义，但今天我认为这是一个非常小的数字。只是为了给你一个数据点。Coinlist，我们已经存在了大约一年，在过去的一年里，我们公开了五个象征性的销售。我们有入境人员要求我们与他们一起工作，超过2500个象征性的销售。

And that's not a bandwidth issue, that's not us not being able to service that, that's us sitting there and saying, these 2，495 tokens, not a good fit for us.

这不是带宽问题，这不是我们不能服务，这是我们坐在那里，说，这2495令牌，不适合我们。

\- That's like one of the largest euphemisms. Not a good fit for you meaning maybe not quite legit.

\-这是最大的委婉语之一。不适合你意味着不太合法。

\- So there's certainly a large set we see of scams, and spam, and frauds, and people that are bad actors, or just shouldn't be involved at all.

\--所以，我们肯定会看到一大堆骗子，垃圾，骗子，以及那些坏演员，或者根本就不应该卷入其中的人。

\- How much, just to riff on that for one sec, how much has been raised on ICOs in 2018 thus far.

\-多少，仅仅是在这一秒，多少已经筹集到2018年到目前为止的ICOS。

\- Estimates vary, it's a tough industry to study, but probably somewhere around $15 billion.

\-估计不同，这是一个很难研究的行业，但可能在150亿美元左右。

It's a big number, more than venture capital.

这是一个巨大的数字，超过了风险投资。

\- Just to repeat that in case someone maybe didn't hear that clearly, more money has been raised in ICO than has been delivered in venture capital to companies in 2018 thus far.

\--再说一遍，如果有人听不清楚的话，到2018年为止，ICO募集到的资金比风险投资公司的资金还多。

\- Yeah, and some people look at that and say, wow, what a great sign for the ICO industry, we are thriving.

\-是的，有些人看着它说，哇，对ICO行业来说，这是一个很好的信号，我们正在欣欣向荣。

I look at that and say, that seems really concerning to me. Because venture capital's been around for, as we've talked about before, almost a century of real true development in venture capital, especially for technology companies, a pretty well developed industry, we figured out the norms, and how these things needs to be created.

我看着它说，这对我来说似乎真的很重要。因为正如我们之前提到的那样，风险投资已经在风险投资领域取得了近一个世纪的真正发展，特别是对于科技公司这个相当发达的行业，我们已经想出了规范，以及这些东西是如何创造出来的。

The idea that ICOs have really only existed for four years, and really in kind of their mass form about two years, the idea that we could surpass that so quickly in that stage of development, I see as actually a more concerning thing than a positive thing for the ICO industry.

ICOS真正存在的时间只有四年，实际上是两年左右的群体形式，在这个发展阶段，我们可以如此迅速地超越这一概念，我认为这实际上是一个更关心的事情，而不是一个对ICOS行业有利的事情。

\- One thing it shows is demand. 'Cause these are proxies for investing in startups, but it also, I guess, shows a propensity for people to believe things that maybe they shouldn't be believing.

\-有一件事就是需求。因为这些都是投资初创公司的代表，但我想，这也显示了人们相信那些他们不应该相信的东西的倾向。

\- Yeah, I think that's right.

\-是的，我想这是对的。

It's also just a function of it being a new industry that it's brand new, it's really hard to diligence for these investors.

作为一个全新的行业，这也是一个新的功能，对于这些投资者来说，这真的很难勤奋。

There aren't norms, there's no data points right now on what tokens are successful, and which ones aren't, we're so early into the industry.

没有规范，现在没有数据表明什么令牌是成功的，哪些令牌是不成功的，我们很早就进入了这个行业。

It's not because everything's failed, it's because it's just too early to know.

这不是因为一切都失败了，而是因为现在还不知道。

And so investors don't have a good sense for how to do diligence.

因此，投资者对于如何勤奋工作没有很好的判断力。

I think about the process--

我在想过程--

\- Or even understanding what they represent, right, because at least if you're buying a penny stock, you still know that that penny stock represents a claim on the future cash flows of that company in one way or another.

\--甚至理解它们代表什么，对吧，因为至少如果你购买一分钱股票，你仍然知道，那一分钱股票以某种方式代表着对该公司未来现金流的要求。

Admittedly, that is a theoretical thing, but at least it's grounded in something concrete.

诚然，这是一个理论问题，但至少它基于一些具体的东西。

A lot of times these ICOs aren't grounded in anything.

很多时候，这些iCOS不是基于任何东西。

\- But I don't think it has to necessarily be quantitative.

\-但我不认为它必须是定量的。

I think about the YC process for admitting companies, and all the data you guys have on years of startups and what succeeds and what doesn't, and what are positive signals, and what aren't, and how you look through those applications, you just can't do that in tokens right now.

我想到了YC公司的准入程序，以及你们拥有的关于创业多年的所有数据，什么成功什么不成功，什么是积极的信号，什么不是，以及你们如何看待这些应用程序，你现在不能用代币来做这些事情。

There's no training data to look at.

没有训练数据可以看。

And so that's resulted in this kind of, we've got to be overly aggressive mentality from investors of let's get in, let's get in, these things are gonna make us rich, and that's, I think, pumped up the amount of money that has gone into the space past where it really reasonably should be.

所以这导致了这样的结果，我们必须从投资者的过度进取的心态，让我们进入，让我们进入，这些东西会使我们富有，我认为，这是泵的数额，已经进入空间过去，它真的应该是合理的。

It may be that that's an important step in the industry's development that you need this kind of huge infusion of capital to give the winners enough money to start to win, and then you can sort out how to diligence it better going forward. But certainly, the vast majority of that money that has gone into ICOs is going to ICOs that are not going to be successful.

也许这是该行业发展的一个重要步骤，你需要大量注入资金，让赢家有足够的钱开始赢钱，然后你就可以找出如何更好地勤奋向前。但是，可以肯定的是，进入iCos的绝大多数资金都将用于那些不会成功的iCos。

\- So just for the edification of everyone here, could you just step back and say what's an ICO. So what are these token things? What does CoinList, like why would you use CoinList? Why can't you just do it? And then maybe we can transition to answer the question you started to talk about, who should think about doing an ICO and who shouldn't?

\-那么，就为了让这里的每个人都得到启发，你能不能退后一步，说出什么是ICO? 这些象征性的东西是什么? COINLIST是什么，为什么要使用COINLIST? 你为什么不能直接做呢? 然后，也许我们可以过渡到回答你开始讨论的问题，谁应该考虑做一个ICO，谁不应该呢?

\- Yeah, and just on terminology for folks that are newer to this space.

\-是的，只是关于那些对这个空间比较新的人的术语。

I tend to use tokens, coins, cryptocurrencies all synonymously, cryptoassets even. Some people have slightly different definitions, I tend to use them all the same.

我倾向于使用代币，硬币，密码都是同义的，甚至是密码资产。有些人的定义略有不同，我倾向于使用它们都一样。

And then ICO, token sale, kind of the same thing in my eyes. So those are generally synonymous.

在我眼里，也是一样的东西。所以这些通常都是同义词。

An ICO, or a token sale, is, ICO, initial coin offering, is when a new network is being created, and a company is issuing tokens for the first time, and its network is starting to distribute them.

ICO，或称代币销售，是ICO，首次发行硬币，是指一个新的网络正在创建中，一个公司正在首次发行代币，并且它的网络正在开始发行代币。

And they've run this token sale to do two things generally. One, to raise money for the future development of that network, and support that network in the long term.

他们通常会做两件事。一是为该网络的未来发展筹集资金，并长期支持该网络。

And two, to get early distribution of those tokens, because these networks like Filecoin only work if there are people who have it to store files, people who have it to give files to be stored, and kind of incentive alignment around that. So you need a way to distribute these tokens initially, one way to do so is to sell them.

第二，要尽早分发这些标记，因为这些网络就像FileCin一样，只有在有人有文件存储，有人有文件存储的情况下才会工作，而且这也是一种激励性的对齐方式。因此，您需要一种方法来分发这些标记，一种方法是出售它们。

And so they go out and conduct these sales where they go and sell tokens to investors, or to users that want to eventually participate on the network.

因此，他们走出去，进行这些销售，他们去，并出售令牌给投资者，或用户谁希望最终参与到网络。

\- And that's a case where the network literally does not work unless you have a token.

\-这是一种情况，网络实际上不工作，除非你有一个令牌。

\- Yeah, that's exactly right. Filecoin is the first token sale that we supported at CoinList.

\-是的，完全正确。FileCin是我们在CoinList上支持的第一个令牌销售。

They raised a staggering $205 million in their initial coin offering. We've worked with a number of other ones since, Blockstack, and PROPS, and Origin, Trust Token, and what CoinList does is for that small set of companies, we support the logistics of the token sale, so there's a bunch of compliance work you need to do, which is probably not worth getting into, but you'll hear these buzzwords, know your customer, KYC, anti-money laundering.

他们在首次发行的硬币上募集了惊人的2.05亿美元。从那以后，我们已经与许多其他公司进行了合作，比如BlockStack和Props，以及Origin，Trust Token，COINLIST为这些小公司所做的工作，我们支持令牌销售的物流，因此您需要做一系列的合规工作，这可能不值得我们去做，但是您会听到这些时髦的词，了解您的客户，KYC，反洗钱。

\- You need lawyers to be involved.

\-你需要律师参与进来。

\- And we have many of them.

\-我们有很多。

And so we handle the compliance, we handle the transactions, so how the payments work, and money comes in, we handle the--

所以我们处理合规问题，我们处理交易问题，那么付款是如何工作的，钱是如何进来的，我们处理的是--

\- You have to know how this is gonna work with the SEC, 'cause they're going to be, already are intimately involved, right?

\-你必须知道这将如何与证券交易委员会合作，因为他们将是，已经密切相关，对吗?

\- Lots of open regulatory questions, lots of closed regulatory questions, you need to know how to be able to answer correctly, and we support these companies through that process and then we'll market some of these deals publicly, or offer them to the investors on our platform to be able to invest in. We also offer other services, like that just compliance piece without the marketing as much we do for a broader set of token issuers, we have this whole other air drops product to give tokens away to users. So you'll start hearing this buzz word, air drops, more and more, I think.

\--很多公开的监管问题，很多封闭的监管问题，你需要知道如何能够正确地回答，通过这个过程，我们支持这些公司，然后我们将一些交易公开上市，或者在我们的平台上向投资者提供这些交易，使他们能够投资。我们还提供其他服务，就像我们为更广泛的令牌发行商所做的那样，在没有市场营销的情况下，我们也提供其他的空投产品，将令牌分发给用户。所以你会开始听到这个嗡嗡的词，空投，越来越多，我想。

This is a way of giving, so we talked about ICOs being a way to fundraise and to distribute tokens to users. Sometimes you might not need to do the fundraising part and you might just want to distribute tokens to a wide set of users. How do you do that? Giveaway, and the first example of an air drop, I would argue, or one of the first, was Paypal, when they got started, and you sign up for Paypal, you get 10 bucks of Paypal credits Wasn't a token obviously, but they were saying, we've got a network, we need people to use this network, we just need to give them a little bit of money to get started, they can send some money, you send it to a friend, pay for something, and then they're gonna get really addicted and start to put more money in.

这是一种给予的方式，因此我们讨论了iCOS是一种筹集资金并向用户分发令牌的方法。有时，您可能不需要执行筹款部分，您可能只想将令牌分发到一组广泛的用户。你怎么做到的? 第一个例子是PayPal，当他们开始时，你注册了PayPal，你得到的10美元的PayPal信用额显然不是一个象征，但是他们说，我们有一个网络，我们需要人们使用这个网络，我们只需要给他们一点钱就可以开始上瘾了，他们可以给他们一些钱，你可以给他们一些钱，就可以开始上瘾了，你可以发送一些钱。

And that's what an air drop is, it's a way of saying--

这就是空投的意思，这是一种说法--

\- And it worked.

\-而且成功了。

\- It totally worked.

\-完全成功了。

\- It worked, totally worked.

\-成功了，完全成功了。

\- You could give tokens away to people, they can start to use them on the network, and then hopefully they become such a fan of that network that they put more of their own capital in to use to it.

\--你可以把代币给别人，他们可以开始在网络上使用代币，然后希望他们成为那个网络的狂热者，把更多自己的资本投入到这个网络中去。

\- Who amongst Startup School world should think about tokens as a way to kickstart their network, to raise funds potentially, and who shouldn't?

\-在初创学校世界里，谁会认为代币是启动他们的网络，筹集资金的一种方式，而谁又不应该这样做呢?

\- Yeah, so today, and this is again where I'd differentiate between today and tomorrow, or the future.

\-是的，那么今天，这也是我区分今天和明天，或者未来的地方。

Today, I think the most valuable applications of this technology are applications where you have parties that are not willing to trust each other.

今天，我认为这一技术最有价值的应用程序是那些你不愿意信任对方的应用程序。

They're not willing to trust each other, they're not willing to trust a central intermediary either, and you need to build this trustless system.

他们不愿意信任彼此，他们也不愿意信任一个中央中介机构，你需要建立这个不信任的系统。

This does not describe a lot of businesses.

这并不能描述很多业务。

\- Where trust is somehow fundamental to the functioning of whatever product you're creating.

\--不管你在创造什么产品，在某种程度上，信任是其运作的基础。

\- Exactly, so if we look at an example that I would say is not a great candidate for a token, there's possibilities, but not a great candidate, would be Airbnb. So on its face, you would say, this actually sounds pretty good, I want to stay somewhere, someone out there I've never met before has a home that I can stay in.

\-确切地说，如果我们看一个例子，我会说，不是一个很好的候选标记，有可能，但不是一个很好的候选标记，将是Airbnb。所以，在它的脸上，你会说，这听起来真的很好，我想呆在某个地方，某个我从未见过的人，有一个我可以住的家。

I don't trust that person, I've never met them before, I've got no connection to them, but I do trust Airbnb. So you can have this intermediary, I have no problem trusting Airbnb, I stay in 'em all the time, and I say, alright if Airbnb's vetted them, and they're backing me up, they've got their insurance thing, they've got all this, no problem, I trust Airbnb, let's do it.

我不相信那个人，我以前从未见过他们，我和他们没有任何联系，但我相信Airbnb。所以你可以有这个中介，我完全可以信任Airbnb，我一直都在他们里面，我说，好吧，如果Airbnb审查了他们，他们支持我，他们有他们的保险，他们有这些，没问题，我相信Airbnb，我们就这么做吧。

That means not a great candidate for a token. But if you start to have systems where you don't trust even the intermediary, much less the person on the other side, that's where a token might be a good fit.

这意味着不是一个伟大的候选人的象征。但是，如果你开始有一些系统，即使你不相信中间人，更不用说对方，那就是一个令牌可能是一个很好的选择。

And the reason I'm not giving you--

我不告诉你的原因是--

\- The Russian version of Airbnb, maybe you'd want a coin for that.

\-俄罗斯版的Airbnb，也许你想要一枚硬币。

\- Totally possible, yeah, absolutely.

\-完全可能，是的，绝对可能。

And trust in institutions is fading, there's all sorts of research on this. Edelman puts out a great survey on trust every year, and so there is an idea that this could be more of a thing of the future. But the reason I'm not answering your question with just a slew of examples I can give you of, like, if your business fits this, do a token, if your business fits this, do a token, if your business, is because I just do not think there are that many today.

对机构的信任正在减弱，对此有各种各样的研究。Edelman每年都对信任进行一次大的调查，因此有一种观点认为这可能是未来的事情。但是，我不回答你的问题的原因是，我可以举许多例子，例如，如果你的业务适合这个，做一个记号，如果你的业务适合这个，做一个记号，如果你的业务，因为我不认为有那么多今天。

And so it's more about finding these very specific use cases where it's particularly valuable to have a token than to try and fit into a category that could have a ton of tokens coming out of it.

因此，更重要的是要找到这些非常具体的用例，在这些用例中，拥有一个令牌比尝试并融入一个可能会有大量令牌出现的类别更有价值。

\- I want to save some time for questions, but just before we move on, you've talked in the past about pros and cons of tokens versus, say, convertibles of various kinds, like YC SAFE that probably most startups use to raise money, both from the perspective of a startup company and from an investor, maybe could we talk a little bit about those?

\-我想节省一些时间来回答问题，但是在我们继续之前，你曾经讨论过代币的利与弊，比如说，各种转换，比如YC Safe，它可能是大多数初创公司用来筹集资金的，无论是从初创公司的角度还是从投资者的角度来看，或许我们能谈一谈这些问题吗?

\- Yeah, so everyone in here, especially here in this class has done a lot of thinking about traditional financing and things like--

\-是的，所以这里的每个人，尤其是这个班的每个人，都做了很多关于传统融资的思考，比如--

\- Or you will, if you haven't.

\-或者你会的，如果你没有。

\- Yes, absolutely, keep an eye out for those lectures.

\-是的，当然，留意那些讲座。

Things like investor protections, what rights do investors get, how do you have to deal with them? How do you fundraise for them? Do you sit down and talk to them, do you follow up, do you do a call? There's all these things that go into a traditional fundraiser, things we think about. With tokens, a lot of that is flipped on its head. So probably the biggest difference is that when you buy into a token, and this goes back to our original discussion of what a token is, the company does not control the network in this ideal form, they release this network, and it goes out into the wild, and you own tokens on that network, you own part of that network. But that means you have no formal relationship to the company as an investor in these tokens.

像投资者保护，投资者有什么权利，你如何处理他们? 你如何为他们募集资金? 你坐下来和他们说话，跟进，打个电话吗? 在传统的筹款活动中，我们会考虑到所有这些事情。有了代币，很多东西都被翻转到了头上。所以，最大的不同可能是，当您购买一个令牌，而这又回到了我们最初关于什么是令牌的讨论中，公司并不以这种理想的形式控制网络，而是释放这个网络，然后它就消失了，您在那个网络上拥有了令牌，您就拥有了那个网络的一部分。但这意味着，作为这些代币的投资者，你与公司没有正式的关系。

And as a company, technically you have no formal relation to the investor that owns your tokens.

作为一家公司，从技术上讲，你与拥有你的代币的投资者没有正式的关系。

And so there's this idea right now in startups of, we talked good and bad investors, like they may call you, they may check in, you've got an obligation to update them, you've got an obligation to get them to sign documents at certain times when transactions happen. When people buy into a token network released by a company, none of these obligations go, and there are pros and cons to that, certainly, on both sides of the equation. On the startup side, on one hand, way easier.

所以现在在初创公司中有这样一个想法，我们谈论好的和坏的投资者，比如他们可能会打电话给你，他们可能会登记，你有义务更新他们，你有义务让他们在交易发生的某些时候签署文件。当人们购买一家公司发布的一个令牌网络时，这些义务都不存在，这当然对双方都有好处和坏处。一方面，在初创企业方面，要容易得多。

These people don't have any stake in your business, you can do whatever you want with the company itself.

这些人在你的业务中没有任何利害关系，你可以做任何你想要的公司本身。

There's no control that they have there.

他们无法控制那里。

The downside of that is, they are not necessarily aligned with you.

它的缺点是，它们不一定与你一致。

The upside of equity is that it's upside. When someone wins with equity, everyone wins with equity, in the general case, obviously there's some edge cases, but incentives are aligned, and that's awesome. With tokens, the incentives of the investors are not necessarily aligned with that of the company. So if the token is pumping up for some reason, and flying up the charts, an investor who invested a ton of money doesn't have any lockups on it, they may just swy, yeah, I'm getting out, I'm up to 10X right now, that seems totally worth it, I'm getting out, and they dump it, and it hurts the price, and it hurts the company by kind of second-order effect there.

股权的优势在于它的优势。当一个人赢得了公平，每个人都赢得了公平，在一般情况下，显然有一些边缘的情况，但奖励是一致的，这是可怕的。有了代币，投资者的动机并不一定与公司的动机一致。所以，如果一个投资了一大笔钱的投资者，由于某种原因，他们的股票价格会不断上涨，而且价格也会不断上涨，他们可能不会有任何损失，对，我现在已经跌到了10倍，这似乎是完全值得的，我要退出，他们会把股票抛在一边，这会对公司的价格造成伤害，而且还会对公司产生一种二阶效应。

And so you get this kind of misalignment. You win because they don't have any stake in your company, but you lose because they don't have any stake in your company.

所以你得到了这种错位。你赢是因为他们在你的公司没有任何股份，而你输是因为他们在你的公司没有任何股份。

And from the investor perspective, the exact flip side of that, which is, on one hand, you're not obligated to the company at all, you can do whatever you want, you just own tokens on a network that they've released. But the other side of that is that you might not get as much visibility into what's happening, you might not get those monthly updates, you might not be as engaged with the founders, you may have never met the founders.

从投资者的角度来看，这是完全相反的一面，一方面，你对公司完全没有义务，你可以做任何你想做的事，你只需要在他们发布的网络上拥有令牌。但另一方面，你可能无法对正在发生的事情有如此多的了解，你可能无法获得每月的更新，你可能与创始人没有那么多的接触，你可能从未见过创始人。

The idea in startup fundraising of raising from people that you've never met before does not really happen that much. Occasionally you see a little bit for certain things.

从你从未见过的人中募集资金的想法并不多见。有时你会看到一些特定的东西。

\- And you'd usually advise against it.

\-你通常会建议我不要这么做。

\- Usually advise against it.

\-通常建议不要这样做。

In token world, many of these sales have had hundreds or thousands of investors that just signed up on the website. You know, CoinList facilitates this. People come and invest in sales where they have never met, talked to, chatted with the founders at all.

在TokenWorld中，许多此类销售都有数百或数千名投资者刚刚在该网站上注册。你知道，Coinlist促成了这件事。人们来投资销售，在那里他们从来没有见过面，也没有和创始人交谈过，也没有和他们聊天过。

\- You can go to CoinList right now and sign up for token sales.

\-你现在就可以去Coinlist注册象征性的销售。

\- You certainly can, you can only participate if you're an accredited investor, unfortunately, site regulation sadly. But yes, you may have no relationship to the founders, again, pros and cons on both sides there.

\-你当然可以，你只能参与，如果你是一个认可的投资者，不幸的是，网站监管悲伤。但是，是的，你可能与创始人没有任何关系，同样，双方都有优点和缺点。

\- It's kind of amazing from an investor perspective, because if you invest in a startup company, usually before you see any return, it's a lot of time, five, 10 years, but with a token, if the token goes up tomorrow, you can invest and sell the next day.

\--从投资者的角度来看，这是一件很棒的事情，因为如果你投资于一个初创公司，通常在你看到任何回报之前，这是一段很长的时间，五年，十年，但是有了一个象征，如果这个象征明天会上升，你可以在第二天投资和卖出。

\- Right, and I do think we are converging.

\-是的，我确实认为我们是一致的。

Tokens, again, are young, I repeat this to myself alL the time, it's such a young industry.

代币，又一次，是年轻的，我一直对自己重复这句话，这是一个如此年轻的行业。

They are converging a little bit more towards venture capital. We're starting to see vesting schedules and lockups for investors, trying to get this incentive alignment a little bit tighter than kind of the freest version that I was just describing, and I think a lot of it's gonna converge that way. Early in the ICO market, companies raised once, they said we're gonna raise one monster token sale, that's gonna be it, we'll never need to fundraise again. More and more, we're seeing people talk about stage things that start to look a lot more like a traditional seed, series A, series B.

他们更倾向于风险投资。我们开始看到投资者的归属计划和限制，试图使这种激励机制比我刚才描述的那种最自由的版本更加紧密，而且我认为其中的许多将会以这种方式聚合起来。在ICO市场的早期，公司曾募集过一次，他们说我们将募集一笔巨大的象征性交易，就这样，我们再也不需要募集资金了。越来越多，我们看到人们谈论舞台上的东西，开始看起来更像一个传统的种子，系列A，系列B。

And so it's gonna look more like venture capital in the future, I think, but there's still gonna be these key differences of what it is that you're buying and what that means for the relationships between the people involved.

因此，我认为，这看起来更像是未来的风险投资，但你购买的是什么，这对相关人员之间的关系意味着什么，仍然存在着这些关键的差异。(实习编辑:顾萍)。(实习编辑:顾萍)。(注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注:注)。

\- Awesome, so in the time remaining, if there's any questions on any of the topics we've talked about. Okay, right here, right in the front row.

\-太棒了，所以在剩下的时间里，如果有任何关于我们讨论过的话题的问题。好的，就在这，就在前排。

\- [Male] I have two questions, one about venture investors. You said good investors, if you could share with us three pinpoints to account for good investors.

我有两个问题，一个是关于风险投资者的。你说的是好投资者，如果你能和我们分享三个要点来说明好投资者。

\- Okay, hang on there, we'll take each one in turn. What are the characteristics of good investors in your view?

\-好的，坚持住，我们一个接一个。你认为优秀投资者的特点是什么?

\- I'll talk about a couple characteristics, and then a way to find out.

\-我会说几个特点，然后找出答案。

The characteristics that I think are really important for investors is, one, alignment with whatever your goals are as an entrepreneur. Not everyone's goals in this room are going to be exactly The same. Some people might be saying, for me, this is a $10 billion business or bust, that is it, that is all I'm going for, and I will always make the decision that leads towards that outcome. Others might say, listen, if I built a $10 million-a-year revenue business, I would be super happy and I'm looking for investors for that.

我认为对投资者来说真正重要的特点是，一，与你作为企业家的目标一致。不是每个人在这个房间的目标都是完全一样的。有些人可能会说，对我来说，这是一个100亿美元的生意或破产，就是这样，这就是我想要的，我将永远作出决定，导致这个结果。其他人可能会说，听着，如果我建立了一个每年1000万美元的收入业务，我会非常高兴，我正在寻找投资者。

If investors are not aligned with that goal, you're going to be in big trouble, because you will eventually make a decision that runs exactly counter to what they want.

如果投资者与这个目标不一致，你将会有大麻烦，因为你最终会做出一个与他们想要的完全相反的决定。

And so you need to make sure they're aligned with you on that. Second, how you interface with them.

所以你要确保他们在这件事上和你一致。第二，如何与它们进行交互。

Is the interaction friendly? It can be intense, they may do diligence, there may be some real back and forth and firing back and forth, but do you walk away feeling good after your interaction with them? If you do not, that is not a good sign, because you are talking to them at a time when it's supposed to be really positive. You're talking about joining forces, a one-plus-one-equals-three situation, if you're walking away and saying, ah, this does not feel totally right, that's a really bad sign, 'cause at some point, in all likelihood, hate to break it to you, things will not go perfectly.

互动友好吗? 这可能是激烈的，他们可能做的勤奋，可能有一些真正的来回和射击，反复，但你走开感觉良好后，你与他们的互动? 如果你不这样做，那就不是一个好兆头，因为你和他们说话的时候，他们应该是非常积极的。你说的是合力，一加一等于三的情况，如果你走开说，啊，这感觉并不完全对，这是一个非常不好的信号，因为在某种程度上，很可能，不愿意把它给你，事情不会完美地进行下去。

And I'm not saying the business is gonna shut down or anything, but you will have a tough time at some point.

我不是说公司会关门什么的，但总有一天你会有困难的。

And if an investor is not great when things are good, or you're talking about possible ways to work together and build something amazing, they will be really bad when things are going poorly.

如果一个投资者在事情好的时候不是很好，或者你在谈论合作和创造奇迹的可能方法，那么当事情不好的时候，他们将会变得非常糟糕。

And so I'd watch out for those, those are kind of my two biggest things.

所以我会小心这些，这是我最重要的两件事。

The last one is, people argue about this all the time, but the idea of value add.

最后一个问题是，人们一直在争论这个问题，但是价值增加了。

I don't think every investor has to be some sort of crazy perfect, they're gonna make some amazing difference in your business, but if they're aligned, and you need capital, and they believe it's a good investment, that can be fine, you don't necessarily need someone that's going to do everything, but when you can find those investors, obviously that can make that introduction for you, give you that customer feedback, whatever it may be, recruit someone, that's tremendously valuable.

我不认为每一个投资者都需要某种疯狂的完美，他们会在你的业务中做出一些惊人的改变，但是如果他们是一致的，你需要资本，他们相信这是一个好的投资，那很好，你不一定需要一个什么都能做的人，但是当你能找到那些投资者的时候，很明显，他们可以为你做介绍，给你客户的反馈，不管它是什么，招募一个非常有价值的人。

The last thing I would say on that is that I think a super underrated part of fundraising is due diligence and reference checks on investors. So few people do this, but it is amazing. You talk to an investor, you're getting towards it, you're saying, Jeff, I think we've got a great relationship here, I'm really excited about working with you, I think we could do something amazing, and I would love to work with you as one of my investors, is it cool, can I talk to some people that you've invested in before? I just want to get a sense of your working style and kind of how we could work together in the future. Now, first of all, if they say no to that, really bad signal, right.

关于这一点，我最后要说的是，我认为筹资中被低估的部分是对投资者的尽职调查和参考调查。所以很少有人这样做，但这是惊人的。你跟一个投资者说，你正朝着这个方向努力，你说，杰夫，我想我们在这里有一段很好的关系，我真的很兴奋能和你一起工作，我想我们可以做些很棒的事情，作为我的一个投资者，我很想和你合作，我能和你以前投资过的人聊聊吗? 我只是想了解一下你的工作方式和我们将来如何合作。现在，首先，如果他们对此说不，那是一个很坏的信号，对吧。

Anytime someone says no to a reference check, bad signal. So they'll probably say yes, and talk to people that he sends you, maybe talk to a couple of other people that you know he's invested in that he didn't send you, and just ask them those questions. Because every founder that's had an investor can give you a very intuitive gut check on, yeah, Jeff's amazing, he was actually there, darkest days, things were tough, he came into the office, helped us figure out product strategy, this happened, that happened.

任何时候有人拒绝推荐信，都是不好的信号。所以他们可能会答应，和他派给你的人交谈，或者和其他一些你知道他投资的人交谈，他并没有派给你，然后问他们这些问题。因为每一个有投资者的创始人都能给你一个非常直观的直觉，是的，杰夫的惊人，他实际上是在那里，最黑暗的日子，事情很困难，他来到办公室，帮助我们想出产品策略，发生了什么，发生了什么。

And then you go back to him, and you say to him, Jeff, I'm even more excited now 'cause I talked to a bunch of these people, and they said you were so helpful in this, you were so helpful on that, let's make this happen.

然后你回到他身边，你对他说，杰夫，我现在更兴奋了，因为我和一群人谈过，他们说你在这方面很有帮助，你在这方面很有帮助，让我们来实现这个目标。

That's the most exciting way to close an investor conversation, highest chance of closing the money, and you've now set expectations around what you hope the relationship will be like.

这是最令人兴奋的方式来结束投资者的谈话，最大的机会关闭资金，现在你已经设定了你的期望，你希望的关系将是什么样子。

And so I would definitely do those calls, it takes time, but is worth it's for investors you're looking to work with.

所以我肯定会打这些电话，这需要时间，但这是值得的投资者，你期待的工作。

\- So that was a solid gold answer. Please, please, please pay attention to Andy's wisdom there. Yes.

\-那是一个金玉良言的回答。请，请，请注意安迪的智慧。是啊。

\- [Female] I am into watching crypto space, so given the nuclear winter that's occurring right now, is CoinList looking to pivot to support STOs, or are you going to stay on the ICO path?

\--(女性)我很喜欢看密码空间，所以考虑到现在正在发生的核冬天，Coinlist是在寻找支点来支持STOS，还是你会留在ICO的路径上?

\- Okay, so the question is, given the nuclear winter in crypto-land, is CoinList looking to pivot to STOs or are you going to stick firmly with ICOs?

\-好的，那么问题是，考虑到密码岛上的核冬天，COINLIST是要转向STOS，还是要坚定地支持ICOS?

\- Yeah, so to unpack that a little bit, STO is a security token offering, and this goes back to what we were talking about before around the blockchain and token infrastructure being something that you can build a lot of different things on, one of those things that people talk about is what's commonly called a security token or an asset-backed token, and this is an idea of taking an existing asset, something that exists in the real world, the traditional world, maybe startup equity, maybe real estate, maybe gold bars, whatever it may be, and building a token that represents that asset. So one token equals one 1% of this building or this building's revenue streams, whatever it is.

\-是的, 所以把它拆开一点, STO是一种安全令牌产品，这可以追溯到我们之前在BlockChain和Token Infrastructure中所说的，你可以在其中构建许多不同的东西，其中一种是人们通常所说的安全令牌或资产支持令牌，这是一种获取现有资产的想法，一种存在于现实世界，传统世界中的东西，可能是初创公司的股票，可能是房地产，可能是金条，也可能是什么。因此，无论这栋建筑是什么，一个象征等于这栋建筑或这栋建筑收入的1%。

And the question is, are we looking to support those, where traditionally we've supported ICOs of these tokens that are more kind of token networks that only exist in the network itself and not in the actual real world.

问题是，我们是否希望支持这些标记，在传统上，我们支持这些标记的ICOS，它们是更多类型的标记网络，仅存在于网络本身，而不存在于实际的现实世界。

\- And I guess you could do an ICO of an STO, it's a little--

\-我想你可以做一个ICO，有点--

\- Totally, so that's where I would go on that is that we are certainly looking to support offerings of security tokens, we don't see that as a pivot. We actually see ourselves as just infrastructure to support sales of tokens.

\-当然，这就是我要说的，那就是我们当然希望支持安全令牌的产品，我们不认为这是一个支点。我们实际上把自己看作是支持代币销售的基础设施。

Thus far, they've happened to be what are commonly called protocol tokens, where they're these kind of network tokens and they function on these networks alone.

到目前为止，它们恰好是通常所说的协议令牌，它们是这种网络令牌，它们单独在这些网络上工作。

If the tokens we're offering are asset-backed instead of network-backed, that makes no difference to us as the platform. We just have to figure out if it's a good fit for our investor base and if that can happen. But ultimately the process for running those sales is exactly the same.

如果我们提供的代币是资产支持的，而不是网络支持的，那么对于作为平台的我们来说没有什么区别。我们只需要弄清楚这是否适合我们的投资者基础，以及这是否可能发生。但最终，这些销售的运作过程是完全一样的。

\- Awesome, yeah.

\-太棒了，是的。

\- [Male] Are tokens currency?

\-[男性]是代币货币吗?

\- Are tokens currency? Regulatory answer, totally depends. Practical answer, yes and no.

\-代币是货币吗? 监管方面的答案，完全取决于。实际答案，是和不是。

In the kind of colloquial form of currency where you're using something to exchange for something else, absolutely, most of these tokens are some sort of object that fits into that category, some might not be. So one example, I often refer to Bitcoin's value as a store of value.

在一种通俗的货币形式中，你用某种东西来交换另一种东西，当然，这些标记中的大多数是某种适合于这个类别的对象，而有些则可能不是。因此，有一个例子，我经常把比特币的价值称为价值存储。

And that means I'm really thinking of Bitcoin most analogous to digital gold. Gold is not a currency, you can use it to exchange for things, but it's not really great for that.

这意味着我真的在考虑比特币，最类似于数字黄金。黄金不是一种货币，你可以用它来交换东西，但它并不是真的很好。

It's more used to store value, put value into it, you can take value out of it, and that's how I see the value of Bitcoin.

它更多的是用来存储价值，将价值放入其中，你可以从中获取价值，这就是我所看到的比特币的价值。

I don't think that's the same for every token. More of these tokens fall into that kind of exchange category. But from a regulatory stance, aside from the kind of colloquial definition, the answer largely is no to that. But in certain cases, maybe yes again depending on the exact characteristics and we can talk about specific examples there.

我不认为这是相同的每一个标记。这些代币中有更多属于这种交换类别。但从监管的立场来看，除了这种通俗的定义之外，答案大多是否定的。但是在某些情况下，也许是的，再一次依赖于确切的特性，我们可以在那里讨论具体的例子。

\- And Bitcoin's complicated, because there's Bitcoin Cash, which is maybe a currency.

\--比特币很复杂，因为有比特币现金，这可能是一种货币。

\- Totally different token. So Bitcoin cash is--

\-完全不同的象征。所以比特币现金是--

\- But it's a totally different currency, although, yeah, maybe that's too much. Yes.

\-但这是一种完全不同的货币，虽然，是的，也许那太多了。是啊。

\- So I have a question. So if Airbnb started today, do you think it would be a right candidate for an ICO?

\-所以我有个问题。那么，如果AIRBNB从今天开始，你认为它是ICO的合适人选吗?

\- If Airbnb did?

\-如果是的话?

\- Yeah, if Airbnb started--

\-是的，如果Airbnb开始--

\- So if Airbnb started today, would they be a good candidate for an ICO?

\-那么，如果AIRBNB今天开始运作，他们会成为ICO的合适人选吗?

\- I don't think necessarily.

\-我认为不一定。

Again, I go back to I trust Airbnb.

再一次，我回到我信任的航空公司。

I have no problem with that, and yes, I'll go forward and rent someone's house through Airbnb and be happy with that.

我对此没有问题，是的，我会走过去，通过Airbnb租别人的房子，并对此感到高兴。

There are arguments that it could be successful in that manner, because maybe it's less fees if there's less of a middleman. But Airbnb does provide valuable services to me as the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for those services.

有些人认为这样做可能会成功，因为如果中间人少了，收费可能会少一些。但Airbnb确实作为消费者为我提供了有价值的服务，我愿意为这些服务付费。

I don't feel like Airbnb is taking unreasonable fees on those transactions, because they provide a lot of services.

我不觉得Airbnb对这些交易收取不合理的费用，因为他们提供了大量的服务。

And so do they need a network? I don't think they need one. Could it be an interesting service? Could it be a potentially competitive service? Absolutely, but if I were starting that business today, I wanted to connect homeowners or apartment owners to people that wanted to stay there, I would probably go the centralized route initially, but with an eye on the crypto space and seeing if there might be opportunities in the future.

那么他们需要一个网络吗? 我觉得他们不需要。这是一个有趣的服务吗? 这可能是一种有竞争力的服务吗? 当然，但如果我今天要开展这项业务，我希望将房主或公寓业主与希望留在那里的人联系起来，我可能会先走集中式路线，但要注意密码空间，看看将来是否会有机会。

The last thing I would say on that is it is underrated today how hard it is to build these token networks, it is so hard.

我最后要说的是，今天我们低估了构建这些令牌网络的难度，这是多么的困难。

They're so young, the tooling is not there, development is incredibly challenging.

他们是如此年轻，工具不在那里，开发是难以置信的挑战。

Augur was really the first ICO that officially launched in a big way, three years from their ICO to launch and they just launched this summer, and the amount of work that went into that is unimaginable.

奥古尔真的是第一个正式推出了一个大的方式，三年来他们的ICO推出，他们刚刚推出今年夏天，工作量是难以想象的。

\- I mean you have to replace the human beings at Airbnb who are building the processes and infrastructure to make it a trusted network, right.

\-我的意思是，你必须替换在Airbnb的人，他们正在建立过程和基础设施，使它成为一个可信任的网络，对吗?

\- With no precedent for how to build these things.

\-没有先例，如何建造这些东西。

And so, even that alone, you're looking at it as a business trying to raise as little money as possible and push forward with what you have, it's a tough move.

因此，即使仅仅是这样，你也会把它当作一个企业，试图筹集尽可能少的资金，推进你所拥有的东西，这是一个艰难的举措。

\- But do you think it's fair to say that there's a faction of crypto world that says, central authority, bad, and we should replace all of those with a trusted network.

\--但你觉得公平地说，有一个密码世界的派别说，中央权威不好，我们应该用一个可信的网络来取代所有这些人。

\- Absolutely, and I think a lot of crypto has its roots in this anarcho-libertarian philosophy that I think was incredibly important for the early days of crypto, because that is one of its core use cases, this avoidance of middlemen, and driving the industry forward with that philosophy is incredibly important. But that's very different from looking at it from a really pragmatic business side.

\-当然，而且我认为很多密码都源自于这种无政府主义-自由派哲学，我认为这种哲学对于早期的密码学来说是非常重要的，因为这是密码学的核心用例之一，避免中间人，并且用这种哲学推动行业向前发展是非常重要的。但这与从务实的商业角度来看待这一问题大不相同。

And there may be some crossover there, but it's not 100%.

可能有一些交叉，但它不是100%。

\- Over there. One question at a time. 'Cause it's really fun to pile 'em on, but there's a lot of people who want to ask questions. So ask the one you really want answered first.

\-那边。一次只问一个问题。因为它真的很有趣，堆叠，但有很多人想问问题。所以先问问你真正想要答案的人。

\- How do you distinguish between value and information?

\-你如何分辨价值和信息?

\- Yeah, so it's a really important question.

\-是的，所以这是一个非常重要的问题。

I think, at its core, you can represent value and information. So I can make online transactions with the internet without tokens and move value around, but what that's really doing is moving symbolic representations of value around, and directing different entities to move it. So when I make a payment with my credit card on the internet, sure, it is just information that is moving.

我认为，在它的核心，你可以代表的价值和信息。因此，我可以与Internet进行在线交易，而无需令牌和移动值，但这实际上是移动值的符号表示，并指示不同的实体移动它。所以当我在网上用信用卡付款时，当然，移动的只是信息。

I'm sending authorization codes, my CVV goes here, and this happens, but ultimately what happens is it goes to the credit card issuing entity and conveys them the information, Andy just spent $10 on this merchant, please debit $10, or put $10 on Andy's balance, and then merchant please, here are $10, you have now been paid for your services. What didn't happen there, the internet did not actually transmit that value.

我正在发送授权代码，我的CVV在这里，这是发生，但最终发生的是，它去到信用卡发行实体，并传达他们的信息，安迪只是花了10美元，这个商人，请借10美元，或把10美元的安迪的余额，然后商人请，这是10美元，你现在支付给你的服务。在那里没有发生的事情，互联网实际上并没有传递这种价值。

Those entities on either side pushed the value from one to the other.

两边的实体将值从一个推到另一个。

They may have done it over the bridge of the internet, but they were the ones that were maintaining the value. What's interesting with this token ecosystem is that the value is actually totally contained in the network.

他们可能是在互联网的桥梁上做的，但他们是那些维护价值的人。令牌生态系统的有趣之处在于，该值实际上完全包含在网络中。

There are no entities that are actually holding that value for you.

没有任何实体为您实际持有该值。

There's no credit card issuer that is keeping an eye on my balance and taking payments from me, and there's no bank on the other side that is holding on to the merchant's money.

没有信用卡发行商监视我的收支状况，也没有银行控制着商家的钱。

Instead, all the value is represented on the network, and people actually own that value. So I have my own keys on that network, I own those tokens, or I own the representation of those tokens, I'm not just owning information that gives me access to someone else owning that value. So at the end of the day, just a single-player example, in my bank account, it's my money, but it's not really my money, the bank has the money, and I just have information that allows me to access that money.

相反，所有的值都是在网络上表示的，人们实际上拥有这个值。所以我在那个网络上有我自己的密钥，我拥有那些令牌，或者我拥有那些令牌的表示形式，我不仅仅是拥有让我能够访问其他拥有这个值的人的信息。所以最终，一个单一玩家的例子，在我的银行帐户中，它是我的钱，但它不是真的我的钱，银行有钱，我只是有信息，允许我访问那些钱。

In the world of tokens, I actually have ownership of that, those are my tokens, because I have the keys to access that, and no one else can do anything with it aside from me who has that access.

在代币的世界里，我实际上拥有它的所有权，那些是我的代币，因为我有进入它的钥匙，除了我谁都不能用它做任何事。

And so when we talk about transmitting value as opposed to transmitting information, it's about direct interactions between nodes.

因此，当我们讨论传递值，而不是传递信息时，它是指节点之间的直接交互作用。

I can pay Jeff with tokens, and it never touches a third party at all. Whereas with information, it requires those third parties, where you're informing them to move money between each other.

我可以用代币付给杰夫，但它从来不碰第三方。然而，有了信息，它就需要那些第三方，在那里你通知他们在彼此之间移动金钱。

\- Yes. So this is I guess more of a comment on the rigidity of networks, once you put them out there, it's hard to then go and change them, and upgrade them, and make them backward compatible to other things, do you agree with that?

\-是的。所以，我想这更多的是对网络刚性的一种评价，一旦你把它们放出去，就很难去改变它们，升级它们，让它们向后兼容其他的东西，你同意吗?

\- Yes and no.

\-是和不是。

I think, again, early days, so there hasn't been a lot built around the upgradability of these networks, and once you put 'em out there, it's harder to make those changes, especially breaking changes.

我想，再说一遍，早期的时候，这些网络的可升级性并不是很强，一旦你把它们发布出去，就很难做出这些改变，特别是一些突破性的改变。

There's more and more infrastructure being built that supports that.

有越来越多的基础设施正在建设，以支持这一点。

It's something that I'm not incredibly concerned about in the future, it's something that feels inevitable that we'll get to a place where there networks can be easily upgraded.

这是一件我在未来并不十分关心的事情，这是一件不可避免的事情，我们会到达一个网络可以很容易升级的地方。

At the same time, it goes back to this idea, no company controls that network.

同时，它又回到了这个想法，没有公司控制那个网络。

And so they can't dictatorially make that change.

所以他们不能听写的改变。

If they make a change and the users on the network don't agree with it, the network will do what's called forking, we could talk for hours about this, where you get two different ones, and this is where the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash piece came in. You know, Facebook makes a change, I can't just make a new Facebook that goes back to the old change, that doesn't work, I don't have access to all of Facebook's infrastructure and code.

如果他们做了一个改变，而网络上的用户不同意，网络将进行所谓的分叉，我们可以讨论几个小时，在那里你得到两个不同的，这是比特币/比特币现金的一块进来。你知道，Facebook做了一个改变，我不能只是做一个新的Facebook，回到旧的改变，那不工作，我没有进入所有的Facebook的基础设施和代码。

In the crypto world, if, say, Protocol Labs made a change to Filecoin that people didn't like, it would be totally possible for people to start back right before that change happened, with the entire history of transactions with all the code, and make a new version of Filecoin, Filecoin Cash.

在密码世界中，如果协议实验室对人们不喜欢的filecoin进行了更改，那么人们完全有可能在更改发生之前就重新开始，拥有包含所有代码的整个事务历史，并制作一个新版本的filecoin，filecoin cash。

\- And it's out of Protocol Lab's control.

\-而且这超出了协议实验室的控制范围。

\- Totally out their hands. So it's about, again, goes back to this incentive alignment thing that, sure, maybe someone can write to this version of the protocol and make changes to it, But they have to make sure that all the users are aligned from an incentive perspective to participate on that same network going forward instead of forking it off.

\-完全把手伸出来。所以，这是关于，再一次回到激励对齐的事情，当然，也许有人可以写到这个版本的协议并对其进行修改，但是他们必须确保所有用户都从激励的角度对齐，以参与到同一个网络中去，而不是将它分岔出去。

\- Or not, because you can fork and then that fork is then backwards-compatible and the new one isn't or vice versa, and so maybe it's easier, because of the ability to fork.

\-或者不是，因为你可以叉，然后那个叉向后兼容，而新的不兼容，反之亦然，所以可能更容易，因为叉的能力。

\- Absolutely, yeah.

\-当然，是的。

\- More questions. Over there.

\-更多问题。那边。

Is it possible for someone who's a node, a person who's part of the network to propose a change that then gets incorporated into the network?

是否有可能有人谁是一个节点，一个人谁是网络的一部分，提出一个改变，然后被纳入到网络?

\- Yeah, absolutely, so anyone, node or otherwise, can try to fork a network and create a new version of it with a change.

\-是的，当然，所以任何人，节点或其他，都可以尝试分叉一个网络，并创建一个新的版本的改变。

There's, again, no special control that these companies have over these networks other than some sort of moral authority. Right, if they created the network, I probably trust them to be kind of the best stewards of that network and know how to build it, they're probably the biggest experts on it, 'cause they built it in the first place. So you're gonna probably go with their version until there's a reason not to.

同样，除了某种道德权威之外，这些公司对这些网络没有特殊的控制。是的，如果他们创建了网络，我可能相信他们是网络中最好的管理员，知道如何构建网络，他们可能是网络上最大的专家，因为他们首先构建了网络。所以你可能会用他们的版本，直到有一个理由不。

And as soon as there's a reason not to, which could either be because they do something bad or because someone else proposes something better.

一旦有理由不这样做，那可能是因为他们做了坏事，也可能是因为别人提出了更好的建议。

They could be going on a great path and making a great product, but if someone else, another node, anyone in this room says, I've got an improvement to Bitcoin, I think it's gonna be better than what the existing core developers are doing, I'm gonna propose that, I'm gonna align people around it and get people's attention around it, that could fork and be more successful and it's totally up to that person to do so.

他们可能会走上一条很好的道路，生产出一个很好的产品，但是如果其他人，另一个节点，这个房间里的任何人都说，我对比特币有了改进，我认为它会比现有的核心开发人员做的更好，我会提议，我会让人们围绕它团结起来，引起人们的关注，这可能会更加成功，这完全取决于那个人。

\- Let me argue that for a sec.

\-让我争论一下。

\- Please.

\-拜托。

\- Isn't it true that to really, these decisions become somewhat democratic, and so the network decides, but isn't it also true that these companies that do ICOs or they create a token tend to hold a significant portion of the currency for themselves, and therefore have the biggest voice on the network?

\-真的，这些决定会变得有点民主，网络也会这样决定，但是，这些做ICOS或他们创造了一个标记的公司往往为自己持有货币的很大一部分，因此在网络上拥有最大的话语权，这难道不是真的吗?

\- Yeah, so a couple things. One is when I'm answering these kind of high-level questions about crypto, I'm thinking purely of the very small set of good tokens.

\-是的，有几件事。一种是，当我回答这些关于密码的高级问题时，我纯粹是在考虑一组非常小的好令牌。

There are lots of bad actors out there that build in all sorts of weird ways to influence the network, but just talking about the kind of ideal of these tokens and blockchain networks, that's where we're going on these questions.

外面有很多坏演员，他们用各种古怪的方式来影响网络，但仅仅是谈论这些标记和块链网络的理想，这就是我们要讨论这些问题的地方。

Absolutely some of these issuers have significant stakes in the network. But a couple things happen, one, the voices are not always based on who has the biggest stake in the network.

当然，这些发行商中的一些人在这个网络中占有重要的地位。但是有几件事发生了，第一，声音并不总是基于谁在网络中拥有最大的利益。

A really important voice is whoever is mining and this is a whole 'nother topic, but what the consensus mechanism is. So on Bitcoin, the Bitcoin core developers is a group of people that have access and can try and change the code of Bitcoin, but it has to be adopted by all the miners, which are these people running huge server farms doing work on the Bitcoin network.

一个真正重要的声音是谁正在挖掘，这是一个整体‘不是一个话题，但什么是共识机制。因此，在比特币上，比特币核心开发人员是一群可以访问并可以尝试更改比特币代码的人，但它必须被所有的矿商采用，这些矿商就是那些在比特币网络上运行大型服务器农场的人。

If those people choose not to adopt it, you can think of the Bitcoin core developers as being from the entity that created Bitcoin, which isn't really true in that case, because again created by pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, but the miners have the power there, not the people that are core developing it.

如果这些人选择不采用比特币，你可以认为比特币核心开发人员来自于创建比特币的实体，在这种情况下，这并不是真的，因为同样是由化名中本聪创建的，但在那里，矿工拥有的是力量，而不是开发比特币核心的人。

And so it depends on, again, how the network makes its decisions.

因此，这又取决于网络是如何做出决定的。

\- So it's complicated.

\-所以这很复杂。

\- It is complicated.

\-这很复杂。

\- Okay, a couple more questions, right there.

\-好的，还有几个问题，就在那儿。

\- [Female] What developments to you expect to see in the ICO industry before ICOs become a viable path for more startups?

\-(女性)在ICOS成为更多初创公司的可行之路之前，你希望在ICO行业看到什么样的发展?

\- Yeah, so what developments would I expect to see in the ICO industry before they become a viable path for more startups? It really depends on, and again this goes back to, it's a really good question, what we mean by, so when we say ICO, we're talking about initial coin offering when we say coin or token, what are we talking about? And that's where it's so many different things. So what we've really been talking about here is a history of successful, or looking to be successful, protocol tokens, these tokens that are network-based that have this trust avoidance, or trustless networks.

\-是的，那么在ICO行业成为更多初创公司的可行之路之前，我希望看到什么样的发展? 这真的取决于，这又回到，这是一个非常好的问题，我们所说的ICO是什么意思，所以当我们说，当我们说硬币或代币时，我们所说的是什么? 这就是很多不同的东西。因此，我们在这里真正讨论的是成功的历史，或希望成功的协议令牌，这些基于网络的令牌，有这种信任回避，或不信任的网络。

I don't think there's a world were every startup is going to need to do that.

我不认为每个创业公司都需要这样做。

I trust my corner store to give me good food, I trust my gro-, you know, so that will always exist.

我相信我的街角商店会给我好的食物，我相信我的老板-，你知道，所以那将永远存在。

And so I don't ever think that every company will need to do a token of that blend. But you can imagine a world, going back to the STO question, where there are tokens that represent company equity, and I am purchasing company equity via a token instead of some other document, an equity round, or a SAFE, or whatever it may be, and maybe there's an underlying SAFE below it, and there's a token that represents it. For that to happen, I think what we'll need to see is just a lot more infrastructure to be built out.

因此，我从不认为每个公司都需要做一个混合的象征。但是你可以想象一个世界，回到STO问题，那里有代表公司权益的标记，而我是通过一个标记来购买公司权益的，而不是其他的文档，一个股权轮，或者一个保险箱，或者不管它是什么，也许在它下面有一个潜在的安全，并且有一个标记来代表它。要做到这一点，我认为我们需要看到的只是需要建造更多的基础设施。

There's reasons that that is a good idea to have these asset-backed tokens, things like increased access to liquidity.

有理由认为拥有这些资产支持的代币是一个好主意，比如增加获得流动性的机会。

There's all these exchanges being built and liquidity pools for increased liquidity for these asset-backed tokens.

为了增加这些资产支持代币的流动性，所有这些交易所和流动性池都在建设中。

They're interoperable with each other, so you can move 'em around more easily.

它们可以互操作，所以你可以更容易地移动它们。

I think, this is a trend Jeff and I have talked about before, generally the arc of venture capital bends towards increased liquidity and speed to liquidity, and these things come faster and faster.

我想，这是杰夫和我之前提到过的一种趋势，一般情况下，风险资本倾向于增加流动性和加快流动性，这些事情来的越来越快。

A little bit of a speed bump in recent years, but generally, I think, moving that way.

最近几年有一点减速，但我认为一般情况下是这样的。

And tokens will only continue that trend. So I do think as infrastructure gets built out, it may make sense for companies to raise equity with tokens that represent that equity.

而代币只会继续这种趋势。因此，我确实认为，随着基础设施建设的进行，公司用代表权益的代币来筹集股权或许是有意义的。

And that is not some sort of crazy ICO phenomenon where you'll be able to go out as a seed-stage startup and say, my token is worth $200 million, no it's gonna represent the equity, and it'll be worth what the equity's worth, maybe with some premium for the benefits of tokenization on top of it, but we need infrastructure there, and until that infrastructure exists, I don't think it's worthwhile except as maybe a proof of concept for people to show that it's possible, but we need more built there and hopefully that gets built in the upcoming months or years.

这不是一种疯狂的ICO现象，你可以作为一个种子阶段的初创公司, 我的信物价值2亿美元，不，它代表的是权益，它代表的是权益，它代表的是权益的价值，也许还有一些额外的好处，但是我们需要基础设施，在基础设施存在之前，我不认为这是值得的，除非这是一个证明，人们可以证明这是可能的，但我们需要更多的基础设施，希望在未来的几个月或几年里能建立起来。

\- Great, one more question. Right here.

\-太好了，再问一个问题。就在这里。

\- [Male] Do you think the future's gonna be a handful of blockchain, or many, many hundreds, and why?

\-(男性)你认为未来会是一小撮人，还是好几百人，为什么?

\- Yeah, do I think the future's gonna be a handful of blockchains or hundreds of blockchains? And you know, I think it'll be a relatively small number of blockchains, but a relatively high number of tokens.

\-是的，我认为未来会是几个块链还是几百个块链? 你知道，我认为它是一个相对较少的块链，但一个相对较高数量的令牌。

And to explain that for just a minute here. Many of these token networks allow for other tokens to be issued on top of them. So the most common buzzword you'll hear, Ethereum, which is the second biggest cryptocurrency out there, has got a blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and they've created standards on top of Ethereum to issue other tokens on top of Ethereum and the one you'll hear tossed around a lot is an ERC-20 token.

在这里解释一下。许多这种令牌网络允许在它们之上发行其他令牌。因此，您将听到的最常见的流行语是Ethereum，这是第二大密码，它有一个块链，即Ethereum块链，它们在Ethereum之上创建了标准，在Ethereum之上发出其他标记，而您将听到的是一个ERC-20标记。

This is a token that is issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain, but represents something other than Ethereum, and its price is not necessarily correlated with that of Ethereum.

这是在Ethereum块链之上发行的一个标记，但它表示的是Ethereum以外的其他东西，它的价格不一定与Ethereum的价格相关。

I don't think there's a need for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of blockchains to exist, because they are a pain to maintain. You need all these users on it with different mechanisms for how they interact with each other, but I do think we're gonna have a world with a lot of different tokens. Maybe not as many as some people think, I'm not kind of a tokens for everything, but if we get to this world of asset-backed tokens where all of a sudden buildings can have tokens that represent their ownership, or companies can have tokens that represent their ownership, that's a lot of tokens that are possible out there, but they will not all have their own blockchains, they will likely be built on something like--

我不认为有必要存在数百个和数百个封锁链，因为他们是一个痛苦的维护。你需要所有这些用户都有不同的交互机制，但是我认为我们将会有一个有很多不同标记的世界。也许并不像有些人想的那么多，我并不是所有东西的代币，但是如果我们到了一个资产支持的代币的世界，突然出现的建筑物可以有代表他们所有权的代币，或者公司可以有代表他们所有权的代币，这是很多有可能的代币，但他们不会都有自己的封锁链，他们很可能是建立在-

\- Which will be very error-prone if they do, right, because it's all new code, and that's

\-如果他们这样做的话，很容易出错，对吗，因为这都是新代码，这是

\- And you need a certain

\-你需要一个

\- All sorts of things

\-各种各样的事情

\- Kind of critical mass

\-临界质量

\- That could break.

\-那会碎的。

\- For it to be safe and secure, and so maybe they'll all be on Ethereum, or Stellar, or one of these other networks. But lots of tokens, relatively few blockchains would be my prognostication.

\-为了它的安全和安全，所以他们可能都在遥远的地方，或者恒星，或者其他的网络之一。但是很多代币，相对较少的块链将是我的预言。

The last point I would make on that is, once again, we are less than a decade into crypto at all. We are less than five years into tokens beyond the very basic building blocks at all.

关于这一点，我要说的最后一点是，我们再一次进入密码学的时间还不到十年。我们还不到五年的时间，就变成了比最基本的组成部分更多的代币了。

That is the earliest, earliest days imaginable of this ecosystem and any prediction I make today stands probably a worse chance of being true than a good one. So who knows, we'll see in the coming decades.

这是这个生态系统中最早的，最早的几天，我今天所做的任何预测都可能比一个好的预测更有可能成为事实。谁知道呢，我们会在未来的几十年里看到。

\- And that's a great way to end, thank you very much for your time, Andy.

\-这是一个伟大的方式结束，非常感谢你的时间，安迪。

\- Thank you, thank you guys.

\-谢谢，谢谢你们。
