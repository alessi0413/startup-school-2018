# A Conversation with Andy Bromberg - Moderated by Geoff Ralston

\- Today is Thursday, which usually means that Adora or myself sit up here with someone notable, and have a hopefully interesting conversation. The someone notable we have today is Andy Bromberg, my friend and the president of CoinList, the president and co-founder of CoinList, which is this really fascinating company that is doing some interesting things we'll talk about. But Andy, maybe we can start by you talking a little bit about your entrepreneurial background, because interestingly, even though you graduated from Stanford a couple years ago, CoinList isn't your first venture, is it?

\-今天是星期四，这通常意味着阿多拉或我和一个引人注目的人坐在这里，并希望有一个有趣的谈话。今天值得注意的是AndyBromberg，我的朋友，CoinList的总裁，CoinList的总裁兼联合创始人，CoinList是一家非常吸引人的公司，它正在做一些我们将要谈论的有趣的事情。但是安迪，也许我们可以从你的创业背景开始，因为有趣的是，即使你几年前从斯坦福大学毕业，CoinList并不是你的第一次创业，对吗？

\- No, that's right. First of all, thank you for having me, and thank you everyone for coming, this is gonna be a lot of fun. The entrepreneurial background for me started even before school, in high school, I was one of those people that started some web design and marketing businesses, nothing really notable, but I think it was really valuable to get that initial experience of building something and hiring a team and managing a team, and firing people, and figuring out how to do--

\-不，这是对的.首先，谢谢你邀请我，谢谢大家的到来，这会很有趣的。我的创业背景甚至在我上高中之前就开始了，在高中的时候，我是那些创办了一些网页设计和营销业务的人之一，但我认为获得建立某种东西、雇佣一个团队、管理一个团队、解雇员工、想出如何做的初步经验真的很有价值-

\- Did you do all those things while you were in high school?

\-你上高中的时候做过所有这些事吗？

\- I did, yeah, I got started, it was a lot of fun doing that.

\-我做了，是的，我开始了，做这件事很有趣。

\- What made you do that? What was it about being an entrepreneur that attracted you while you were still in high school? God, in high school, I was worried about other things.

\-是什么让你这么做的？在你还在高中的时候，作为一名企业家吸引你的是什么？天啊，在高中的时候，我还在担心其他的事情。

\- It was really nothing about being an entrepreneur, and more about not wanting to do other jobs that I was able to do when I was in high school. You know, you can sit there, and you can do whatever, serve pizza, or scoop ice cream, or whatever it is.

\-这与我作为一名企业家无关，更重要的是我不想做我在高中时能够做的其他工作。你知道，你可以坐在那里，你可以做任何事，提供披萨，或舀冰激凌，或任何东西。

\- I worked in a supermarket. It was awesome.

\-我在超市工作.太棒了。

\- I did the scooping ice cream, too, yeah, it was fun, but I was looking at it and saying, all these businesses in my town have awful websites, and I've got a bunch of friends that do this stuff in their spare time, and that seems like just a way better way to make a little bit of money while I'm in high school than serving pizza. So I went into that, and expanded out to videos, marketing, photos, all that stuff, ran a few websites that did pretty well. But it was really less of I want to be an entrepreneur, and more of I really don't want to do these other jobs. And it then developed into a love for building things from the ground up and trying to create, but at the time it was purely an alternative, not a primary.

\-我也做了冰激凌，是的，很有趣，但我看着它，我说，我们镇上所有的企业都有糟糕的网站，我有一群朋友在业余时间做这些事情，这似乎是一个更好的方式来赚一点钱，在我上高中时，比提供比萨饼。所以我开始研究，并扩展到视频，市场营销，照片，诸如此类的东西，运行了一些做得很好的网站。但我不太想成为一名企业家，而更多的是我真的不想做其他的工作。然后，它发展成了一种爱，从地面到地面，并试图创造，但在当时，它只是一个选择，而不是一个初级。

\- So you were really weren't thinking of this as, I'm an entrepreneur, and I'm gonna, my family's been entrepreneurs forever, it was more an escape, an alternate route from sort of the normal high school, I'm gonna get some, maybe not so interesting job and do something more interesting. And probably you made a lot more money doing it, too.

\-所以你真的没想过，我是个企业家，我要，我的家人永远都是企业家，这更多的是一种逃避，从普通高中的另一条路，我会找到一些，也许不是很有趣的工作，做一些更有趣的事情。也许你也赚了更多的钱。

\- Yeah, absolutely, and I think, and not to fall into some of the immediate startup cliches, but I was doing stuff that I really enjoyed doing. I was hanging out with my friends, and building things, which was really fun, I enjoyed that. We built a bunch of websites around just things that we liked, and it wasn't necessarily that we're looking at it and saying, I'm gonna analyze this opportunity and do my TAM calculation and figure out this and the business strategy, we just said, I love playing soccer, what if I made a website that reviewed soccer cleats? We're like, alright, let's do that, and we made one of those, it did really well. I like messing around with computers, let's build one around how to dig into the internals of a Mac and do things with it. Let's build that, that did pretty well. And it was really based on these things that we just enjoyed doing, we had figured out how to do and wanted to build these sites around our passions.

\-是的，当然，我认为，不要陷入一些直接的创业陈词滥调，但我做的事情，我真的很喜欢做。我和我的朋友们在一起，做东西，这真的很有趣，我很享受。我们围绕着我们喜欢的东西建立了很多网站，但并不是说我们会分析这个机会，做我的TAM计算，找出这个和商业策略，我们只是说，我喜欢踢足球，如果我建了一个网站来评论足球的情况呢？我们就像，好的，让我们这样做，我们做了其中一个，它做得很好。我喜欢摆弄电脑，让我们围绕着如何挖掘Mac的内部并使用它来构建一个。让我们来建造它，做得很好。这真的是基于这些我们喜欢做的事情，我们已经想好了如何做，并想要围绕我们的激情建立这些网站。

\- I'm intrigued, so this was going pretty well. You're probably a senior in high school, you get into a little school on the West Coast, did you ever have the thought like, I'm not going to Stanford, I'm gonna just, I am the next, whatever, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm going?

\-我很感兴趣，所以这件事进行得很顺利.你可能是高中四年级的学生，你进入了西海岸的一所小学校，你有没有想过，我不会去斯坦福，我只是，我是下一个，不管是什么，马克·扎克伯格，我要走了吗？

\- Yeah, I don't, I think those really, truly would have been delusions of grandeur at that point. These were little things, they were fun, and they made money, and I covered my expenses and was able to do what I wanted to do, but none of these were going to be massive businesses. Sure, of course, the thought occurs, you're like, ah, I could just keep doing this, I'm surviving on this, this would be fun. But ultimately, I got a great opportunity to go to a great school and decided to do that. And continued to do them for a little while while I was there, and did some of that stuff, but kind of trailed off during the couple years I was there, and then eventually kind of tailed off completely.

\-是的，我不知道，我认为在那个时候，那些真的会是一种虚幻的幻想。这些都是小事情，它们很有趣，而且他们赚了钱，我支付了我的开支，并且能够做我想做的事，但这些都不会是大规模的生意。当然，这个想法发生了，你就像，啊，我可以一直这样做，我靠这个生存下来，这会很有趣。但最终，我有了一个很好的机会去上一所很棒的学校，并决定这么做。我继续做了一会儿，做了一些这样的事情，但是在我在那里的这几年里，我有点落后，然后最终完全被拖了下来。

\- The idea of starting companies didn't, because apparently the bug hit you again while you were at Stanford, right?

\-创办公司的想法没有，因为很明显，你在斯坦福大学的时候，这个错误又给你带来了沉重的打击，对吗？

\- Yeah, that's right. I was there for a couple years, had a lot of fun. Really, actually, the most impactful bit there was tied into this whole entrepreneurship thing, which is I took this amazing class wen I was there called Startup Engineering from a guy named Balaji Srinivasan, who's now the CTO of Coinbase, and formerly the CEO of earn.com, and formerly a partner at Andreesen Horowitz, and founder of Counsyl. Amazing guy, who actually lectured at the very first-ever Startup School. And he taught this class about, I think a lot of times university classes around entrepreneurship don't teach you the real skills you need to start a business. They might teach you some really high-level things, or really basic fundamentals, but nothing around the pragmatic steps, and he set out to build a class, much like this one, that said, no, if you're actually going to do this, what do you need to do? And it was a lot of time with guest lecturers coming to the class, there was a lot of time with, things like it was a computer science class, how do you deploy code, how do you do revision control on code, and how do you put it on Github, and how do you do these different things, the practical pieces. And we took this class, a bunch of us, and had an amazing time, and actually out of that, which we'll come full circle back to this, a small set of folks that were in that class ended up founding the Stanford Bitcoin Group, back in 2012-2013.

没错没错我在那里呆了几年，玩得很开心。事实上，最有影响力的一点是与整个创业相关的，那就是我从一个名叫Balaji Srinivasan的家伙那里学到了一个很棒的课程-我在那里叫Startup工程-他现在是Coinbase的首席技术官，以前是earn.com的首席执行官，以前是Andreesen Horowitz的合伙人，也是Counsyl的创始人。了不起的家伙，他在第一所创业学校讲课。他教过这门课，我认为很多时候，围绕创业的大学课程并不能教你创业所需要的真正技能。他们可能会教你一些非常高级的东西，或者基本的基础知识，但是没有任何关于实用主义的步骤，他开始建立一个类似于这个课程的课程，说，不，如果你真的要这样做，你需要做什么？和客座讲师们一起上课有很多时间，就像计算机科学课，你如何部署代码，如何对代码进行修改控制，以及如何将其放在Gizub上，以及如何做这些不同的事情，实用的部分。我们上了这门课，我们一群人，度过了一段美妙的时光，实际上，我们将回到这个圈子里，一小群人最终在2012-2013年创立了斯坦福比特币集团。

\- I hope they bought some Bitcoin.

\-我希望他们买了一些比特币.

\- Not enough, never enough. So he convinced us all, this Bitcoin thing is gonna be real. At the time, we're looking at him and saying, no way, man. I mean, this is 2012, we're like Bitcoin is magic internet money, I don't believe you for a second, this doesn't work. And he said, come on, let's do it, and so we started the Stanford Bitcoin Group, and spent a couple years in school doing a lot of awesome research and evangelism and had a lot of fun running around teaching people about crypto, and building things, and researching things. But then, yeah, ultimately I did end up leaving to start a different company, and left even that behind.

\-不够，永远不够所以他说服了我们，比特币的事会是真的。当时，我们看着他说，不可能，伙计。我的意思是，这是2012年，我们就像比特币是神奇的互联网货币，我一点也不相信你，这是行不通的。他说，来吧，让我们这么做吧，于是我们创立了斯坦福比特币集团，在学校里花了几年时间做了很多很棒的研究和传道活动，并且有很多乐趣跑来跑去教人们有关密码的知识，建造东西，研究东西。但后来，是的，最终我确实离开了，开始了另一家公司，甚至把它抛在脑后。

\- So that different company was Sidewire, which interestingly seems like it's more relevant today, maybe more than Bitcoin, because it was all about real news, right?

\-因此，不同的公司是Sidewire，有趣的是，它似乎今天更相关，也许比特币更重要，因为它都是关于真正的新闻的，对吗？

\- Yeah, so I built this platform called Sidewire, and I left school in 2014 to start this company, and I left early because I found what I think is the perfect partner for it, my co-founder Tucker, who had a background in politics, and I had this background in computer science, and building things, and we came together to build this product that was a platform where the experts in politics could chat publicly about the news of the day, and everyone else could read and engage, but not participate on that same level. We wanted to build kind of Twitter without the noise. What if you took just the experts and put them in conversation with each other? And we did this really around the 2016 election. So it was 2014 to, we ended up winding it down last year at 2017, but--

\-是的，所以我建立了一个叫Sidewire的平台，我在2014年离开学校创办了这家公司，我很早就离开了，因为我找到了我认为是最好的合作伙伴，我的联合创始人Tucker，他有政治背景，我有计算机科学和建筑领域的背景，我们一起构建了这个产品，这是专家们的平台。在政治上，可以公开谈论当天的新闻，其他人也可以阅读和参与，但不能在同一层次上参与。我们想要建立一种没有噪音的Twitter。如果你只带着专家们和他们交谈呢？我们在2016年的大选中做到了这一点。所以是在2014年，我们去年在2017年结束了它，但是.

\- It sounds like we need it really badly.

\-听起来我们真的很需要它.

\- I think we still do. And I talk to a lot of people that are building similar products, trying to separate out the signal from the noise, and hopefully some of you in here are online or are working to do that too, because I think it's such a critical problem. Turns out, very hard problem for a variety of reasons, but I think it's critical that someone solve it.

\-我想我们仍然需要.我和很多生产类似产品的人交谈，试图把信号从噪音中分离出来，希望在座的一些人能上网，或者也在努力做到这一点，因为我认为这是一个非常关键的问题。事实证明，困难的问题有各种各样的原因，但我认为有人解决这个问题是至关重要的。

\- Maybe for the benefit of these folks, never fear, we will talk about crypto, talk a little bit, if you would, about the process of starting the company. You left school to do it, and the winding down, like what happened? And maybe if there's some lessons learned in there from that experience.

\-也许为了这些人的利益，永远不要害怕，我们会谈论密码，如果你愿意的话，谈一谈创办公司的过程。你离开学校去做这件事，然后就结束了，就像发生了什么？如果有一些经验教训的话。

\- Yeah, absolutely, so the starting was really, it always is kind of the best part. When you have this germ of an idea and you're trying to turn it into something, and so we started, Tucker and I met and started talking, we were introduced by a mutual friend named Adam while I was still in school, and we started talking about this concept that there's this crazy noise level in the discourse today, especially around politics and other topics, can we separate that out? We had a lot of different ideas around how to do it and iterate it through a million different things. And ultimately, he was working at that time a great job, I was in school, we were looking at it, as I'm sure many people are saying, this is a big leap to take to go from very comfortable situations, I had a couple years left of school, he was, again, doing great at work, to make this leap. And so we said, alright, we got to a place where nine months in of kind of casual discussions, 'cause we were both working and learning, we said we think we know what we want to do here,

\-是的，绝对的，所以起跑线是真的，这是最好的部分。当你有了这个想法的雏形，你试图把它转化成某种东西，所以我们开始了，塔克和我相遇，并开始交谈，我们是由一个共同的朋友亚当介绍的，在我还在学校的时候，我们开始讨论这个概念，在今天的讨论中有一个疯狂的噪音水平，特别是关于政治和其他话题，我们能把它分开吗？我们对如何做到这一点有很多不同的想法，并且在无数种不同的事情中迭代它。最后，他当时工作很好，我在学校，我们在看，我相信很多人都说，这是一个很大的飞跃，从非常舒适的环境，我还有几年的学校，他再次，在工作上做了很好的工作，以实现这一飞跃。所以我们说，好吧，我们到了一个地方，在那里我们进行了9个月的非正式讨论，因为我们既在工作，也在学习，我们说我们知道我们想在这里做什么，

\- And the timing was,

\-而时机是，

\- The timing was great. We're looking at this, this is right before summer 2014. So we know we've got some lead time up into the elections to build stuff, and then launch into the election cycle. We thought we knew what we wanted to build, and so we said, alright, well, we need to get some validation for this before we get going, which was just the state of mind that we were in. I don't think this is always true for entrepreneurs by any means, but our state was we're both in great positions, this is gonna be really hard, let's get some validation. So we went out and said we're gonna raise some money, and if we can successfully raise that money, let's go and do it. The commitment kind of was that if we could do that before the summer, I would go obviously over my summer and work on it full-time and then beyond, and he would leave the job and go and we'd do it together. And so were able to put together that money and get that validation and start building.

\-时机很好.我们来看看这个，就在2014年夏天之前。所以我们知道我们在选举中有一些准备时间来建立一些东西，然后进入选举周期。我们认为我们知道我们想要构建什么，所以我们说，好吧，在我们开始之前，我们需要对此进行一些验证，这正是我们所处的心态。我不认为这对企业家来说总是正确的，但是我们的状态是我们都处于很好的位置，这将是非常困难的，让我们得到一些验证。所以我们走出去，说我们要筹到一些钱，如果我们能成功地筹集到这笔钱，我们就去做吧。我们的承诺是，如果我们能在夏天之前做到这一点，我就会很明显地度过我的暑假，然后全职工作，然后再做下去，他会离开这份工作，然后我们一起去做。因此，他们能够把这笔钱集中起来，得到验证，然后开始建设。

\- Did you raise from angels then?

\-你是从天使那里长大的吗？

\- Yeah, almost entirely from angels, yeah. And we had an amazing set of investors. Lesson learned, and thankfully we didn't learn it in the negative way, having great investors is such a boon throughout the business when things are going well and when things are going poorly, and we'll get to the wind down, but even that part, having an amazing set of investors that were aligned with us, cared about us as people, and were supportive of what we were doing was so critical at that point. And really digging in on what their motivations were was really important. See, we raised from a lot of people, we had, I forget the exact number now, but something like 44 investors in our seed round or something like that.

\-是的，几乎完全来自天使-是的我们有一群了不起的投资者。值得庆幸的是，我们并没有以负面的方式学到这一点。当事情进展顺利，事情进展不佳时，拥有伟大的投资者对整个企业来说都是一件好事，而且我们会走下坡路，但即便是这部分，拥有一群与我们站在一起的令人惊叹的投资者，作为人关心我们，支持我们所做的事情，在那一刻也是如此的关键。深入了解他们的动机是非常重要的。你看，我们是从很多人那里培养出来的，我现在忘了确切的数字了，但是在我们的种子圈里，大约有44名投资者，或者诸如此类的东西。

\- Did you ever think that maybe that was too many?

\-你有没有想过那可能太多了？

\- Yes and no. The only time I ever genuinely thought that,

\-是和不是。我唯一次真心实意地想过，

\- 'Cause you never really wanna turn down money, right?

\-因为你从来不想拒绝金钱，对吗？

\- The only time I genuinely thought that was too many was when I was dealing with meeting all of them to sign things. But generally, again, it goes back to the quality of the investors. They were supportive and not annoying and never nagged us. And we sent out our monthly updates, made sure they were informed and it was never a problem, it was just sending out 44 Docusigns is a lot of Docusigns to send out, but outside of that it was fine.

\-我唯一次真正认为这是太多的时候，是在我处理与他们所有的人会面时签署协议的时候。但总的来说，这又回到了投资者的素质。他们支持我们，不烦人，从不唠叨我们。我们每月都会发送更新信息，确保他们被告知，这并不是什么问题，它只是发送了44个DocuSigns-很多DocuSigns都要发送出去，但除此之外，这还不错。

\- You can imagine one issue with 40, or 50, or 60 investors is that even if you really try to only get high-quality investors, the probability that one or two of those are difficult gets pretty high.

\-你可以想象一个40，50，60名投资者的问题是，即使你真的只想吸引高质量的投资者，其中一两个困难的可能性也会很高。

\- Absolutely, and of course, even within that set of 44, there was a spectrum of people ranging from absolutely perfect to slightly less perfect. But on the whole, it was a really great set, and we were fortunate to be supported by them. And so we ended up doing that, and the short story on the company is we built for about a year, and then we raised the last part of that round, it was all one big round, but raised the last part of that round from Spark Capital, who were amazing investors, highly recommend working with them, and they kind of completed our institutional seed round. And then we launched the product, and ran it for a couple years, and ultimately wound it down last summer, yeah, 2017, mid-2017, and I think from a product perspective--

\-当然，即使在44人的范围内，也有各种各样的人，从绝对完美到稍微不那么完美。但总的来说，这是一个非常好的场景，我们很幸运能得到他们的支持。所以我们最终做到了这一点，这个公司的短篇小说是我们建造了大约一年，然后我们提出了这一轮的最后一部分，这是一个大的回合，但是从SparkCapital筹集了这一轮的最后一部分，他们是出色的投资者，强烈推荐与他们合作，他们差不多完成了我们的机构种子回合。然后我们推出了这个产品，运行了几年，并最终在去年夏天结束了，是的，2017年中期，我认为从产品的角度来看-

\- Just before you get there, so you went all the way through the 2016 presidential cycle, did you guys have any insight more than the rest of us about what was going to happen in November 2016 based on the experts' discussions that were taking place?

\-就在你们到达那里之前，你们一路走过了2016年的总统周期，根据专家们的讨论，你们对2016年11月将要发生的事情有比我们更多的洞察力吗？

\- There's things I can say and things I can't say. We were talking to a lot of smart people,

\-有些事我可以说，有些事我不能说.我们和很多聪明人谈过，

\- Say the things you can't say, no.

\-说那些你不能说的话，不.

\- That's a good one. Yeah, there's a lot of--

\-这是个好主意.是啊，有很多-

\- [Female] That's exactly what happened.

\-(女性)就是这样发生的。

\- That was exactly what happened.

\-事情就是这样发生的.

\- [Female] Unexpected results.

\-[女性]意外结果。

\- There's a lot of smart people out there, and this ties into what Sidewire was able to do, but also who we were talking to. We got this amazing set of experts on the platform engaging like crazy, about 1,000 people, senators, presidential candidates, reporters, analysts, staffers, like all the people you would want to have talking, the really smart voices, the smart commentators, having these amazing discussions, going back and forth, firing back and forth, being entertaining. We felt like that side, 'cause it was a marketplace, right, You had supply of content and demand of content, no one was paying, but supply and demand. We crushed the supply, and just no matter what we did we couldn't get people to pay attention to it, which we thought was so interesting. So our thesis going in, and I think a lot of the time startups are about having a thesis and testing it, but a thesis we felt really strongly about, it wasn't so far as build it and they will come, but we thought, this is a marketplace, a two-sided marketplace, if we can get the supply, if we can get smart people to have smart conversations about the news of the day, then we will be able to get people that show up to stick around and keep engaging with those conversations and reading them. No matter what we did, and there's no way to know what the issue was, we could not get people to come and stick around. People would show up and read one conversation, and then would not come back, and I think, at the end of the day, what we felt like was in that space it's hard to get people to care about the smart conversations. People say that's what they're looking for, and it might not actually be what drives them and what they actually want.

\-外面有很多聪明人，这与Sidewire能够做的事有关，但也与我们交谈的对象有关。我们在这个平台上找到了一批惊人的专家，他们疯狂地参与，大约1000人，参议员，总统候选人，记者，分析家，工作人员，就像所有你想要交谈的人，真正聪明的声音，聪明的评论员，进行这些惊人的讨论，前后来回射击，很有趣。我们感觉到了那一面，因为这是一个市场，对吧，你有内容的供应和内容的需求，没有人支付，只有供给和需求。我们粉碎了供应，不管我们做了什么，我们都无法让人们注意到这一点，我们认为这是非常有趣的。所以我们的论文开始了，我认为很多时候创业公司都是关于论文的编写和测试，但是我们非常强烈地认为，这篇论文还没有建立起来，他们会来的，但是我们认为，这是一个市场，一个双边的市场，如果我们能得到供应，如果我们能让聪明人对这个消息进行聪明的对话的话，我们就会想到，这是一个市场，一个双边的市场。到了今天，我们就能让那些出现在我们身边的人继续参与这些对话并阅读它们。不管我们做了什么，也不可能知道问题出在哪里，我们也无法让人们前来逗留。人们会出现并阅读一段对话，然后就不会回来了，我想，在这一天结束的时候，我们感觉到的是，在这个空间里，很难让人们关心那些聪明的对话。人们说这就是他们想要的东西，而这可能并不是他们真正想要的和驱动他们的东西。

\- They want 140 or 280 characters of sensational tweets.

\-他们想要140或280字的耸人听闻的推文。

\- I hope that that's not true, and I hope that we had issues with the product that were deeper than that, or something like that, that caused it to not be effective in retaining users, but at the end of the day, we had a really tough time even given just a stream of crazy, high-quality content from the best people in the world on these topics. Tough to get those people to stick around.

\-我希望这不是真的，我希望我们的产品有问题，比这更深，或诸如此类的东西，导致它不能有效地留住用户，但最终，我们遇到了一段非常艰难的时间，即使仅仅是一个疯狂的，高质量的内容，从世界上最好的人在这些主题。很难让那些人留下来。

\- Okay, so this is a tough question for any startup to answer, which is at some point you decided it wasn't an issue of tweaks, it wasn't an issue of being able to find product market fit, that you could pivot 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 180 degrees, it wasn't gonna happen, and you wound the company down, how did you guys come to that decision?

\-好吧，对于任何一家初创公司来说，这都是一个很难回答的问题，在某个时候，你认为这不是一个调整的问题，这不是一个能够找到适合产品市场的问题，你可以把它转向10度，20度，180度，这是不可能的，你让公司破产了，你们是怎么做出这个决定的？

\- Yeah, so we did try a couple other related, but more than 10- or 20-degree tweaks, but related topics, a subscription service that we tried for a little bit, and pitched some enterprise-related things. Ultimately we decided that what we were looking at, the possibilities we were looking at, even if they succeeded couldn't be venture-scale businesses that we needed to be betting on. These are conversations we had with our investors, super honest, transparent conversations with them, with our team, with each other, and we said, alright, well, our core business that we've envisioned and been working on for two, three years, don't think that one's gonna work, at least without some crazy change at how people are thinking, or us having some insane insight of fixing something's that terribly broken. These other businesses we're looking at, other business lines, there's a possibility, but these aren't the type of returns that we're looking for, our investors are looking for when we started this business. And so at that point we said, alright, instead of trying to keep this thing on life support, let's wind it down and move to our next thing and keep building from there. And it was a decision that everyone was incredibly supportive of, again, this goes right back to the good investor thing. It is easy for people to give you a lot of grief when you make a decision like that, but we were incredibly fortunate to have an amazing set of investors that supported us in that.

\-是的，所以我们确实尝试了一些其他相关的，但超过10或20度的调整，但相关的主题，一个订阅服务，我们尝试了一点点，并提出了一些企业相关的东西。最终，我们决定，我们所看到的，我们正在寻找的可能性，即使它们成功了，也不可能是我们需要押注的风险规模的企业。这些是我们和投资者的谈话，非常诚实，透明的谈话，我们的团队，彼此，我们说，好吧，我们的核心业务，我们已经设想并致力于两三年了，不要认为一个人会成功，至少在人们的思维方式没有一些疯狂的改变的情况下，或者我们有一些疯狂的洞察力去修复一些严重的问题。我们正在寻找的其他业务，其他的业务线，有一种可能性，但这些并不是我们想要的回报，而是我们的投资者在我们创业的时候所寻求的回报。所以在那个时候，我们说，好吧，不要试图让这个东西维持生命，让我们把它松开，转到我们的下一个东西，然后继续从那里开始。这是一个每个人都非常支持的决定，再一次，这可以追溯到好投资者的问题上。当你做出这样的决定时，人们很容易给你很多悲伤，但我们非常幸运，有一群令人惊讶的投资者在这方面支持了我们。

\- Okay, last question on Sidewire. Do you think, if you could've persuaded President Trump to call you fake news, you might've been able to survive?

\-好的，最后一个问题是侧线你认为，如果你能说服特朗普总统称你为假新闻，你可能还能活下来吗？

\- We've talked about that a lot. I don't think so. It's so bizarre, we could talk for hours about this, people would show up and engage, and then they'd just kind of, like, disappear. They'd be like, this just doesn't do it for me. And we'd talk to people, and they'd say, yeah, oh it's great, the content's really good, I would never go and read a ton there, really pick it up. You know, there's not a lot of people out there that pick up the New York Times every day and read it cover to cover, and that's effectively the same type of person that we were looking for, someone that cared about that level of discourse.

\-我们已经讨论了很多次了.我不这样认为这太奇怪了，我们可以聊上几个小时，人们会出现并参与进来，然后他们就会消失。他们会觉得，这对我来说是行不通的。我们会和人们交谈，他们会说，哦，太棒了，内容真的很好，我永远不会去读一吨的书，真的会把它捡起来。你知道，没有多少人每天都会拿起“纽约时报”的封面来阅读，这实际上就是我们要找的那种人，一个关心这种对话的人。

\- You have to somehow make it a habit. This is true for any startup. You have to somehow create enough value so that you get integrated into people's lives, and it's hard to do that with news.

\-你必须让它成为一种习惯.对于任何一家初创公司来说都是如此。你必须以某种方式创造足够的价值，这样你才能融入人们的生活，而新闻很难做到这一点。

\- And I do think, you alluded to people want 140 or 280 characters of crazy stuff. Sure, there's an element of that that is people want the crazy things that just spew up, fake news this, fake news that, whatever it is. But the other piece of that is that it's easiest to create a habit with something that's bite-sized. And what we were asking people to do was read a real conversation, it was kind of like an iMessage format, like people were going back and forth and having these back-and-forth conversations. That's not bite-size, takes you a few minutes to read, if not longer, to read these really engaging ones, and they're smart people saying smart things, you gotta think about what they're saying. And jumping from not engaging with a service to engaging with a long conversation you have to read is a big jump to make. And so I think, yeah, to your point, building habits is so crucial and habits are easiest started with something very small that might eventually expand to something big, and think about how much time many people spend on Facebook, but it often starts with something really small there to build that habit. Facebook has great things around you sign up, connect with 10 friends, they've got these numbers of you need to do this, you need to do that. It's all easy, it's all limited time, and then the habit starts to get ingrained and you can build it out bigger from there.

\-我确实认为，你暗示人们想要140或280字的疯狂的东西。当然，这其中的一个因素是人们想要疯狂的东西，只是想吐出来，假新闻，不管它是什么。但另一件事是，用咬人大小的东西来养成习惯是最容易的。我们要求人们读一段真正的对话，这有点像一种iMessage格式，就像人们来回地进行这些对话一样。这不是咬人的大小，你需要几分钟的时间去阅读，如果不是更长的话，去读那些真正吸引人的东西，而他们都是聪明的人，说着聪明的事情，你必须考虑他们在说什么。从不参与一项服务到参与一段长时间的谈话，你必须阅读，这是一个很大的飞跃。所以我认为，是的，在你看来，养成习惯是非常重要的，习惯最容易从一些很小的东西开始，最终扩展到一些大的东西上，想想很多人在Facebook上花了多少时间，但通常是从一些很小的东西开始，来养成这个习惯。Facebook有很棒的东西在你周围注册，和10个朋友联系，他们有很多你需要做的，你需要做的。这一切都很简单，都是有限的时间，然后这个习惯开始根深蒂固，你可以从那里建立更大的习惯。

\- Okay, so let's, let's transition to talk about Andy Bromberg phase 2.5, where you went back a little bit to, I wouldn't say your crypto roots, but back to some of the work you'd been doing earlier at Stanford, and got involved with, I guess, Naval and AngelList and eventually CoinList, how did that transpire?

\-好吧，让我们来谈谈安迪·布罗姆伯格第2.5期，你回到了，我不会说你的密码根，但回到你在斯坦福大学之前做的一些工作，我想，海军和安杰利斯特，最后是CoinList，这是怎么回事？

\- Yeah, so even to take a step further back than that, when I left school in 2014, I was crazy interested in crypto, I was spending a ton of time on it with the Stanford Bitcoin Group and my friends and people in the industry, and the reason I didn't feel comfortable doing anything in crypto at that time was because of a secular issue for me which was, at that point in 2014, I couldn't make a decision, I thought it was a coin flip, whether or not there was gonna be one cryptocurrency forever, Bitcoin was gonna be it and that was gonna be the end of it, or if there were gonna be a ton of cryptocurrencies out there. And I was looking at it and saying startups, high failure rate already, do I wanna add a 50% coin flip to that, because anything I could think of betting on relied on one of those two outcomes. And I said I don't want to add 50% more to an already high attrition rate, so I'm gonna not do this for now. By the time it came back, end of last, or middle of last--

\-是的，甚至更早的时候，当我在2014年离开学校的时候，我对密码非常感兴趣，我花了大量的时间和斯坦福比特币集团，我的朋友和业界的人在一起，而当时我不愿意用密码做任何事情，是因为我的一个长期问题。在2014年的那个时候，我无法做出决定，我认为这是一个硬币翻转，是否会永远存在一种加密货币，比特币将成为它的终结，或者如果有大量的密码货币存在。我看着它，说初创公司，高失败率，我是否想再加50%的硬币翻转，因为我能想到的任何赌注都依赖于这两种结果之一。我说过我不想再给已经很高的自然减员率再增加50%，所以我现在不会这么做。当它回来的时候，最后的结束，或者最后的中间-

\- Usually the attrition's rate so high that 50% hardly makes a difference.

\-通常情况下，自然减员率如此之高，以至于50%几乎没有什么区别。

\- That's another way to look at it. Double your chance of failure is not a bet I want to take often. 2017, I'm looking at it and saying, I'm now a believer, there's going to be at least more than one, who knows how many, successful cryptocurrencies in the long run, we can talk more about what that number might be, and how we should think about that. I feel comfortable going back into this space now. And the story with CoinList is that, CoinList was started about a year ago, just over a year ago, we just celebrated our internal one-year anniversary, and it was created as a collaboration between Protocol Labs, proud Y Combinator company, and AngelList to run Protocol Labs token sale for their product Filecoin, for their token Filecoin.

\-这是另一种看法你失败的几率翻倍不是我想要的。2017年，我看着它说，我现在是一个信徒，至少会有一个以上的人，谁知道从长远来看有多少个成功的密码货币，我们可以更多地谈论这个数字，以及我们应该如何看待这个数字。我现在回到这个地方感觉很舒服。CoinList的故事是，CoinList成立于一年前，就在一年多前，我们刚刚庆祝了我们的内部一周年，它是作为协议实验室、自豪的Y组合公司和AngelList为他们的产品Filecoin运营协议实验室令牌销售的合作而创建的。

\- And I think that you have to unpack that a little bit. I was trying to think about how, hopefully a lot of the people here and out there understand cryptocurrencies, and there's lots and lots and lots and lots that's been written and said about them, but maybe we can sort of very briefly outline what a cryptocurrency is, what a token sale is, what a token is, and why you might be selling them.

\-我认为你必须把它打开一点.我试着想一想，希望在座的很多人都能理解密码货币，还有很多人写了很多关于密码货币的文章，但也许我们可以简单地概述一下密码货币是什么，令牌销售是什么，以及为什么你要出售密码货币。

\- Yeah, yeah, three more hours everyone? I think at its core a token is a scarce digital asset, we'll talk more about what each of these things mean, a scarce digital asset that represents ownership, most commonly of a token network. So the idea here is that when you launch a token network, it goes out and no one then controls it. So Bitcoin, as a lot of you know, was created by this pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, I don't know if that's a he, or a she, or a single person, or a group of people, no one knows who Satoshi is. And somehow--

\-是的，再过三个小时？我认为令牌的核心是一种稀缺的数字资产，我们将更多地讨论每一种事物的含义，一种稀缺的数字资产，它代表所有权，最常见的是一个令牌网络。所以这里的想法是，当你启动一个令牌网络时，它就会熄灭，然后没有人控制它。所以，你们很多人都知道，比特币是由这个化名中本聪(Satoshi Nakamoto)创造的，我不知道是他，还是她，或者是一个人，或者是一群人，没有人知道谁是佐藤史(Satoshi)。不知怎么的-

\- Which is weird, right? This really important thing that's made and lost fortunes for people, and maybe will be the basis of the future economy, no one knows where it came from. Weird, right?

\-这很奇怪，对吧？对于人们来说，这是一件非常重要的事情，可能会成为未来经济的基础，没有人知道它是从哪里来的。很奇怪对吧？

\- Yeah, like really let that settle, it's worth like $100 billion right now, the total market cap of Bitcoin, and no one knows who made it. And in fact, Satoshi has some large number of tokens socked away in a wallet somewhere that has never been used. We have billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, we have no idea who has that, literally no idea.

\-是的，就像真的让它和解吧，现在它的价值大概是1000亿美元，比特币的总市值，没人知道是谁制造的。事实上，Satoshi在一个从未被使用过的钱包里储存了大量的令牌。我们拥有价值数十亿美元的比特币，我们不知道谁拥有比特币，实际上根本不知道。

\- If anyone has it.

\-如果有人有

\- If anyone, right. That is kind of the ultimate ideal how to think about it, that that's possible. You can launch this token network and have it go out into the world and have nobody control it, and it just kind of happens. And so what these companies are now doing when they launch these new tokens, like Protocol Labs launching Filecoin, their intention is to build a network. Got a lot of code to write, they've gotta build this thing, and they're gonna put it out there into the world, and they're of course gonna continue to support it as core developers of the product and improve the network, but they won't actually have control over it. The users, whoever those users may be and whatever categories they may fit into for that specific network, are the ones that have control over that network.

\-如果有人的话，对.这是一种终极的理想-如何去思考，这是可能的。你可以启动这个令牌网络，让它进入世界，没有人控制它，它就这样发生了。因此，这些公司现在正在做的事情，当他们推出这些新的令牌，如协议实验室启动Filecoin，他们的意图是建立一个网络。有很多代码要写，他们必须构建这个东西，他们会把它放到世界上，他们当然会继续支持它，作为产品的核心开发者并改进网络，但是他们不会真正控制它。用户，无论这些用户是谁，以及他们为该特定网络可能属于的任何类别，都是控制该网络的用户。

\- Well, talk about what Protocol Labs was doing. The token that Protocol Labs, this first token that CoinList was working on was not, you could say Bitcoin is a value in and of itself, it's like a new currency, but the token for Protocol Labs was inextricably linked to a different value that was being delivered to consumers, right?

\-好吧，说说实验室在做什么CoinList正在开发的第一个令牌，你可以说比特币本身就是一种价值，就像一种新的货币，但是协议实验室的令牌与交付给消费者的另一种价值有着千丝万缕的联系，对吧？

\- Yeah, yeah, we should talk about that. One other thing I wanna mention just on tokens in general, and this analogy's a little bit abused, but there's one reason I use it, I would think of tokens and blockchain technology, which powers many tokens, like the internet for one really core reason. If I asked you, hey Jeff, I've got a website, and here's a bunch of data about it, how do you value it? It's impossible to answer that question, because if that website is NYTimes.com, or Amazon.com. Or Google.com, or Facebook.com, those are all totally different businesses. They are all built on the internet, sure, but you look at each of their revenues, they've got different multiples,, how do you think about how these businesses are built. Saying how do you value a website is kind of a meaningless question, you have to know much more about the specific use case and how it's built, and in the same way, I think there's a lot of discussion, I get the question a ton from people, okay, but how do we value these tokens? And to me, that's a little bit of an impossible question because tokens are built on different premises and have different applications, and you can break them down into categories and think about how to value each of those categories, in the same way you could say, well how do we value a social networking website, or how do we value a news website, or how do we value a CPG website? But you have to think about those categories, and the idea of a token or blockchain technology is really just this kind of meta concept that allows for other things to be built on top of it. And one more piece of that analogy would be that I'd draw a similarity between the internet is infrastructure for exchanging and transacting information, it moves information around, tokens and token networks are infrastructure for transacting or exchanging value. So for the first time we can actually kind of programmatically exchange value in this core way.

\-是的，我们应该谈谈这个.还有一件事我只想在令牌上提及，这个比喻有点被滥用了，但我使用它的一个原因是，我会想到令牌和区块链技术，它为许多令牌提供了动力，比如互联网，有一个真正的核心原因。如果我问你，嘿，杰夫，我有一个网站，这里有很多关于它的数据，你是如何评价它的？要回答这个问题是不可能的，因为如果那个网站是NYTimes.com或者Amazon.com。或者Google.com或者Facebook.com，这些都是完全不同的业务。当然，它们都是建立在互联网上的，但是你看看它们的每一笔收入，它们有不同的倍数，你怎么看待这些企业是如何建立起来的。说你如何评价一个网站是一个毫无意义的问题，你必须更多地了解具体的用例以及它是如何构建的，同样的，我认为有很多讨论，我从人们那里得到了很多问题，好吧，但是我们如何评价这些标记呢？对我来说，这是一个有点不可能的问题，因为令牌建在不同的前提上，有不同的应用程序，你可以把它们分解成不同的类别，并考虑如何评估每一个类别，就像你可以说，我们如何评价一个社交网站，或者我们如何评价一个新闻网站，或者我们如何评价一个CPG网站？但是你必须考虑这些类别，而令牌或区块链技术的想法实际上就是这样的元概念，它允许在此基础上构建其他东西。还有一个类似的例子是，我认为互联网是交换和交易信息的基础设施，它可以移动信息，令牌和令牌网络是交易或交换价值的基础设施。因此，我们第一次能够以这种核心方式，以编程的方式交换价值。

\- One of the strange things about the whole conversation, so here's how I would answer your question about how to value a website. And it actually is the way people have always valued things, which is, well, I would say, tell me about the cash flows that that website will generate over time, and then historically we've figured out ways to value those things using things like net present value and all these economic concepts. But tokens seem somehow different, because they don't necessarily seem to be tied to cash flows.

\-整个谈话中的一件奇怪的事情，下面是我如何回答你关于如何评价一个网站的问题。这实际上是人们一直重视事物的方式，也就是，嗯，我要说的是，告诉我网站会产生什么样的现金流，然后从历史上看，我们利用净现值和所有这些经济概念找到了对这些东西进行估值的方法。但令牌似乎有所不同，因为它们不一定与现金流挂钩。

\- Yeah, so let's talk about Filecoin like you were saying, just as an example, and this is again just one example of many, and one of many categories. I'll give kind of a quick description of Filecoin and how it works, and we can go into it more in the Q&A. So Filecoin is a token that allows for the exchange of files, storage of files. It's aiming to solve this problem of how do you store files, and transact for that, and build a market for storing files. And so if you think about the simplest solution to how would one build a business to solve that problem, the simplest solution probably looks something like Amazon S3. If Jeff has files that he wants to store, and I'm saying I'm gonna start a business that helps him store these files, I'm probably gonna buy a bunch of servers, and Jeff's gonna hand me files, I'm gonna put them on the servers, when he asks for them back, I'm gonna hand them back, and he's gonna pay me. So that works, big businesses today are built like that, but it has a few problems. So, one, you've got someone that's taking fees, I'm charging on top of the storage costs for him to be able to do this, but there's also issues of things like censorship. So I now have access to his files, I can censor them, I can look at them, I can do whatever I want to them, and you're relying on a single third party not to mess anything up. So I could corrupt the files, I might have downtime and not be able to return them. And so you start to say, well, is there a better solution than this? And the first version of a better solution I think looks a lot like the Airbnb of file storage, where you'd say, alright, well instead, there's a whole bunch of people out there who have extra storage space in their computers,

\-是的，让我们像你所说的那样谈论Filecoin，就像一个例子，这也是许多例子中的一个，也是许多类别中的一个。我将简要描述Filecoin以及它是如何工作的，我们可以在Q&A中更详细地介绍它，因此Filecoin是允许交换文件、存储文件的令牌。它的目的是解决这个问题，如何存储文件，并为之进行交易，并建立一个存储文件的市场。因此，如果你想出最简单的解决方案来解决这个问题，那么最简单的解决方案可能类似于AmazonS 3。如果Jeff有他想要存储的文件，我是说我要开始一家帮助他存储这些文件的公司，我可能会买一堆服务器，Jeff会把文件交给我，我会把它们放到服务器上，当他要回来的时候，我会把它们还给我，然后他会付钱给我。因此，这是可行的，今天的大企业都是这样建造的，但它也有一些问题。所以，第一，你有一个收取费用的人，我向他收取额外的存储费用，使他能够做到这一点，但也存在一些问题，比如审查制度。所以我现在可以访问他的文件，我可以审查他们，我可以看他们，我可以对他们做任何我想做的事，你们依靠一个第三方不搞砸任何事情。这样我就可以破坏文件，我可能有停机时间而不能返回它们。所以你开始问，嗯，有比这更好的解决方案吗？第一个版本的更好的解决方案，我认为看起来很像Airbnb的文件存储，在那里你会说，好吧，相反，有一大群人在他们的电脑中有额外的存储空间，

\- Yeah, raise your hand if you have extra storage space on your computer, seriously, raise your hand, come on, all of you. You all have extra space, no? Your computers are full?

\-是的，如果你的电脑上有额外的存储空间，就举起你的手，真的，举起你的手，来吧，所有的人.你们都有多余的空间，不是吗？你的电脑满了？

\- Let's do it, we're pivoting, Airbnb for files. I would say maybe, alright, well now, Jeff, hand me your files, I'm gonna find someone out here, I'm connected to all of you, I've got software on your computers, I'm gonna put the files on your computer, and then when Jeff wants them back, I'll ask for them back, I'll take 'em, I'll give 'em to him, he'll pay me, I'll pay you, I'll pay me.

\-开始吧，我们在转，Airbnb找文件我会说，好吧，现在，杰夫，把你的文件递给我，我会在这里找到一个人，我会连接到你们所有人，我在你们的电脑上有软件，我会把文件放回你的电脑上，然后当杰夫想要回来的时候，我会把它们要回来，我会把它们拿回给他，我会把它们给他，他会付钱给我，我会付钱给你，我会付钱给我。

\- Yeah, so these people, the few people who raised their hands here will rent, like Airbnb, they'll rent a piece of their storage that they're not using to the network.

\-是的，所以这些人，少数在这里举手的人会租，就像Airbnb，他们会租一个他们没有用在网络上的存储空间。

\- So that's a good solution, but it doesn't solve all the problems we talked about. It does, first of all, make it a little bit cheaper most likely, because this is kind of latent storage space. It's cheaper then buying new servers, but still, there's a middleman, right, there's an intermediary, me, who could go down, I could have downtime, I could censor the files, again, I could look at them, so you're still trusting someone. So Filecoin, Protocol Labs building Filecoin and the underlying thing called IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, which is the coolest name for a file system ever, said, is there a way to solve this? Can we connect Jeff directly to people out here who have extra storage space with no trusted intermediary? That's the problem that Filecoin is trying to solve. They build this token for a few reasons. One, Filecoin is used as the mechanism of payment. So Jeff pays you to store his files with Filecoin. But there's a couple interesting problems we have to solve. First of all, what if one of you does something bad? You corrupt his files, you lose them, you don't return them fast enough, so the first step of the solution is to make each of you that is storing his files for him already have Filecoin. So if you have extra storage space, you already have to have Filecoin, and you do what's called staking. You take those tokens and you put them up effectively in escrow, and you say, here, I'm putting my own tokens up, I'm putting something at stake and if I get caught doing something wrong, if I don't return his files fast enough, if I don't return them at all, then I lose my tokens. So you are disincentivized from doing something bad to Jeff's files. That's interesting step number one. Then you're on to the second problem, which is who's the judge of that? If we're not trusting a central intermediary, how do we know if you are not storing the files well, or corrupting them, or how do we know if you're not returning them fast enough? And that's where step two of this really interesting solution comes into play, which is that there's a massive network outside of this room, thousands of people of what they call verifiers. And I'm gonna oversimplify what they do a little bit, because they have this crazy thing called proof of space-time, over the top, we could talk for hours about it, but a simple solution for how to make sure that each of you is storing his files correctly is that 1,000 different people come to Jeff and they each say to Jeff, hey Jeff, what's the 46th letter of your file, what's the 127th letter of your file, what's the 196th letter of your file? And Jeff says, it's J, A, and K. And then they go to each person that's storing the files and they ask that exact same question. That person who asked about the 47th letter says, hey, what's the 47th letter of the file you're storing? You answer that's J, and they'd check, A, K, and now all of a sudden, when enough verifiers do that we can say with confidence that the person storing the files for Jeff is doing so correctly. And at that point, the network says, great job everyone, Jeff pays you for storing his files, you get your staked tokens back, Jeff gets his files if he wants them, and the verifiers get rewarded by effectively mining, new tokens are minted by the network and given to the verifiers for doing that work.

\-所以这是一个很好的解决方案，但它并不能解决我们讨论过的所有问题。首先，它让它更便宜一些，因为这是一种潜在的存储空间。这比买新服务器更便宜，但还是有一个中间人，对吧，有个中间人，我，他可能会倒下，我可以停机，我可以检查文件，再一次，我可以看看，所以你仍然信任某人。所以Filecoin，构建Filecoin的协议实验室和基础的IPFS，星际文件系统，它是文件系统史上最酷的名字，它有办法解决这个问题吗？我们能直接将Jeff连接到这里没有可信中介的额外存储空间的人吗？这就是Filecoin想要解决的问题。他们构建这个令牌有几个原因。第一，Filecoin作为支付机制。杰夫付钱让你用Filecoin存储他的文件。但有几个有趣的问题我们必须解决。首先，如果你们中的一个做了坏事怎么办？你破坏了他的文件，你丢失了它们，你返回的不够快，所以解决方案的第一步就是让每个为他存储他的文件的人都有Filecoin。因此，如果您有额外的存储空间，您已经必须拥有Filecoin，并且您执行所谓的存储操作。你拿着这些代币，你把它们有效地放在代管里，你说，在这里，我把我自己的代币放上去，我把一些东西放在危险中，如果我被抓到做了什么错事，如果我没有足够快地归还他的文件，如果我根本不归还它们，我就会丢失我的标记。所以你对杰夫的文件不感兴趣。这是有趣的第一步。第二个问题是，谁是这个问题的评判者？如果我们不信任一个中央中介，我们如何知道您是否没有很好地存储这些文件，或者破坏它们，或者我们如何知道您是否返回它们不够快？这就是这个真正有趣的解决方案的第二步，这就是在这个房间外面有一个庞大的网络，成千上万的人，他们称之为验证者。我会稍微简化一下他们所做的事情，因为他们有一个疯狂的东西叫做时空证明，在顶部，我们可以谈论几个小时，但是一个简单的解决办法是如何确保你们每个人都正确地存储他的文件，那就是1000人来到Jeff那里，他们每个人都对Jeff说，嘿，Jeff，你的第46个字母是什么？档案，你的档案的第127字母是什么，你的档案的196字母是什么？杰夫说，是J，A和K，然后他们去找每个存储文件的人，问同样的问题。那个问起第47封信的人说，嘿，你存储的文件的第47个字母是什么？你回答是J，他们会检查，A，K，现在突然，当足够多的验证者这样做时，我们可以自信地说，为Jeff存储文件的人做得很正确。在这一点上，网络说，每个人都做得很好，Jeff付给你存储他的文件的钱，如果他想要的话，Jeff会得到他的文件，而验证者可以通过有效的挖掘得到回报，新的令牌是由网络制造出来的，然后交给验证者来完成这项工作。

\- Which makes the supply of coins expand over time.

\-这使得硬币的供应随着时间的推移而扩大。

\- Exactly, and so then you have this market where each of these three parties, the person with the files, the person with the storage space and these verifiers are all incentivized to do the right thing, disincentivized from doing the wrong thing, and there is no trusted intermediary, and you avoid all those problems I cited with the S3 example at the beginning. That really gets to the core of what this all is, and I'll stop rambling in a second here, but blockchains and tokens are about incentive alignment. It's about this question of how can you build a trustless system, a system where no party has to trust any other party in a system without anyone being involved in managing that, and the way to do that is to properly incentivize everyone and build these economic systems that allow for that interaction to happen.

\-正是这样，你就有了这个市场，在这个市场里，这三方中的每一方，拥有文件的人，拥有存储空间的人和这些验证者都被激励去做正确的事情，不鼓励做错误的事情，而且没有可信的中介，而你避免了我在一开始引用的S3例子中的所有问题。这才是这一切的核心，我马上就不会再胡扯了，但是区块链和令牌是关于激励匹配的。这是一个关于如何建立一个不信任的系统的问题，在这个系统中，没有人参与管理，任何一方都不需要信任任何一方，而这样做的方法是适当地激励每个人，建立这些经济体系，让这种互动得以发生。

\- I think that's one of the best articulations I've heard of what the blockchain-based tokens are about, incentive alignment, but they're about one more thing, isn't it true that they're also about removing, aligning the incentives of the folks in the network so that you can remove the central authority. So that you can remove Amazon in the S2 case, or the United States government, The Fed, in the Bitcoin case, right?

\-我认为这是我听说过的最好的表达方式之一，基于区块链的令牌是关于激励一致性的，但它们还有一件事，不是吗？它们也是关于消除、调整网络中人们的激励机制的，这样你就可以撤销中央权力机构了。这样你就可以在S2案件中删除Amazon，或者美国政府，美联储，在比特币案件中，对吗？

\- Right, and that's for any number of reasons, and that goes back to, it could be for pricing reasons, it could be that the middleman is charging fees that are unreasonable, it could be for censorship reasons, the middleman is censoring, it could be for fear of surveillance, it could be for any number of reasons. But ultimately the most common and effective use of these blockchain systems is to, yes, remove that middleman and make it so this trustless system can exist just between the counterparties that need to be involved in a transaction.

\-对，这有很多原因，可以追溯到，可能是因为定价的原因，可能是中间商收取的费用不合理，可能是出于审查的原因，中间商正在审查，这可能是出于对监视的恐惧，也可能是出于各种原因。但是，这些区块链系统最常见和最有效的使用，是的，移除那个中间人，使它能够存在于需要参与交易的交易对手之间。

\- That's kind of the ultimately democratic version of networking, right?

\-这是一种最终民主的网络，对吗？

\- Markets for everything, yeah.

\-什么都买，是的.

\- Everyone out here in Startup School world might be asking themselves, cool, crypto, cool, tokens, what does that have to do with me? What does this have to do with startups? You and I have talked a bit about the history of investing, and we've come to this place where tokens are, in fact, an important component of how startups raise money and exist. Maybe you can talk a little bit about this evolution to where, to ICOs, initial coin offerings, and the role CoinList is playing.

\-在创业学校世界里的每个人都可能会问自己，酷，秘密，酷，代币，这和我有什么关系？这和初创公司有什么关系？你和我谈到了投资的历史，我们来到这个地方，事实上，令牌是创业公司筹集资金和生存的重要组成部分。也许你可以谈谈这个演变到哪里，ICO，首次投币，以及CoinList正在扮演的角色。

\- Yeah, so probably a little bit of an unusual perspective here, CoinList, we run token sales, we make money when people work with us to run their token sales, that's great. I think today token sales are a good idea for an incredibly, incredibly, incredibly small number of companies. I think of the 27,000, is that right, companies in Startup School, there may be a few where it's a really good idea for a token to exist, not all 27,000 today. There are cases I can make for in the future and making sense for a broader set, but today I think it's a very small number. Just to give you a data point on that. CoinList, we've existed for about a year, we've publicly worked with five token sales in the last year. We have had inbound people asking us to work with them more than 2,500 token sales. And that's not a bandwidth issue, that's not us not being able to service that, that's us sitting there and saying, these 2,495 tokens, not a good fit for us.

\-是的，所以这里可能有一点不寻常的观点，CoinList，我们经营令牌销售，当人们和我们一起经营令牌销售时，我们会赚钱，这很好。我认为今天的令牌销售对于一小部分难以置信的公司来说是个好主意。我想到了27，000家，对吧，创业学校里的公司，一些令牌的存在也许有一些是一个很好的主意，而不是现在的2.7万个。有些情况我可以在未来做，也可以在更广泛的范围内解决，但今天我认为这是一个很小的数字。只是为了给你一个数据点。CoinList，我们已经存在了大约一年，在过去的一年里，我们公开销售了五种令牌。我们有入境人员要求我们与他们合作，销售2500多件令牌。这不是带宽问题，也不是我们不能服务的问题，那就是我们坐在那里说，这2，495个令牌，对我们来说不太合适。

\- That's like one of the largest euphemisms. Not a good fit for you meaning maybe not quite legit.

\-这就像是最大的委婉语之一。对你来说不太合适，意思是不太合法。

\- So there's certainly a large set we see of scams, and spam, and frauds, and people that are bad actors, or just shouldn't be involved at all.

\-所以我们确实看到了大量的骗局，垃圾邮件，欺诈，以及那些坏演员，或者根本不应该参与进来的人。

\- How much, just to riff on that for one sec, how much has been raised on ICOs in 2018 thus far.



\- Estimates vary, it's a tough industry to study, but probably somewhere around $15 billion. It's a big number, more than venture capital.

\-估计各不相同，这是一个很难研究的行业，但可能在150亿美元左右。这是一个很大的数字，不仅仅是风险投资。

\- Just to repeat that in case someone maybe didn't hear that clearly, more money has been raised in ICO than has been delivered in venture capital to companies in 2018 thus far.

\-再重复一遍，如果有人没听清楚，到目前为止，ICO筹集的资金比风险投资公司到目前为止提供的资金还要多。

\- Yeah, and some people look at that and say, wow, what a great sign for the ICO industry, we are thriving. I look at that and say, that seems really concerning to me. Because venture capital's been around for, as we've talked about before, almost a century of real true development in venture capital, especially for technology companies, a pretty well developed industry, we figured out the norms, and how these things needs to be created. The idea that ICOs have really only existed for four years, and really in kind of their mass form about two years, the idea that we could surpass that so quickly in that stage of development, I see as actually a more concerning thing than a positive thing for the ICO industry.

\-是的，有些人看着它说，哇，对ICO行业来说，这是一个多么好的迹象，我们正在蓬勃发展。我看了看，说，这对我来说是很令人担心的。因为风险投资已经存在了，就像我们之前说过的那样，风险投资已经有了近一个世纪的真正发展，尤其是对于科技公司，一个相当发达的行业，我们弄清楚了规范，以及这些东西需要如何创造。ICO真的只存在了四年，并且以质量的形式存在了大约两年，在那个发展阶段，我们可以这么快地超越这个概念，我认为对ICO行业来说，这实际上是一件更令人担忧的事情，而不是一件积极的事情。

\- One thing it shows is demand. 'Cause these are proxies for investing in startups, but it also, I guess, shows a propensity for people to believe things that maybe they shouldn't be believing.

\-它显示的一件事是需求。因为这些是投资初创企业的代理，但我想，这也显示出人们倾向于相信那些他们不应该相信的事情。

\- Yeah, I think that's right. It's also just a function of it being a new industry that it's brand new, it's really hard to diligence for these investors. There aren't norms, there's no data points right now on what tokens are successful, and which ones aren't, we're so early into the industry. It's not because everything's failed, it's because it's just too early to know. And so investors don't have a good sense for how to do diligence. I think about the process--

\-是的，我认为这是对的.这也只是一个功能，它是一个新的行业，它是全新的，这是真的很难勤奋对这些投资者。没有规范，没有数据点来说明哪些令牌是成功的，哪些是不成功的，我们进入这个行业太早了。这不是因为一切都失败了，而是因为现在知道还为时过早。因此，投资者对如何进行勤奋没有很好的了解。我在想这个过程-

\- Or even understanding what they represent, right, because at least if you're buying a penny stock, you still know that that penny stock represents a claim on the future cash flows of that company in one way or another. Admittedly, that is a theoretical thing, but at least it's grounded in something concrete. A lot of times these ICOs aren't grounded in anything.

\-或者甚至理解它们代表什么，对吧，因为至少如果你买了一只便士股票，你仍然知道便士股票以某种方式代表着对该公司未来现金流的一种要求。诚然，这是一件理论上的事情，但至少它是建立在某种具体的基础上的。很多时候，这些ICO都是毫无根据的。

\- But I don't think it has to necessarily be quantitative. I think about the YC process for admitting companies, and all the data you guys have on years of startups and what succeeds and what doesn't, and what are positive signals, and what aren't, and how you look through those applications, you just can't do that in tokens right now. There's no training data to look at. And so that's resulted in this kind of, we've got to be overly aggressive mentality from investors of let's get in, let's get in, these things are gonna make us rich, and that's, I think, pumped up the amount of money that has gone into the space past where it really reasonably should be. It may be that that's an important step in the industry's development that you need this kind of huge infusion of capital to give the winners enough money to start to win, and then you can sort out how to diligence it better going forward. But certainly, the vast majority of that money that has gone into ICOs is going to ICOs that are not going to be successful.

\-但我不认为它必须是定量的.我想到了YC接纳公司的过程，以及你们所拥有的关于几年初创企业的所有数据，哪些是成功的，哪些是不成功的，哪些是积极的信号，哪些不是积极的信号，以及你如何看待这些应用程序，你现在无法在令牌中做到这一点。没有训练数据可看。这就导致了这种情况，我们必须从投资者那里获得过度进取的心态，让我们进入，这些东西会让我们变得富有，我认为，这就是，我认为，大量的资金流入了真正合理应该存在的领域。也许这是这个行业发展的重要一步，你需要这种巨大的资本注入，让赢家有足够的钱开始赢，然后你就能找到更好的办法，让它更好地向前发展。但当然，绝大部分投入ICO的资金都流向了那些不会成功的ICO。

\- So just for the edification of everyone here, could you just step back and say what's an ICO. So what are these token things? What does CoinList, like why would you use CoinList? Why can't you just do it? And then maybe we can transition to answer the question you started to talk about, who should think about doing an ICO and who shouldn't?

\-所以，为了启发在座的每一个人，你能退后一步说什么是ICO吗？那么这些令牌是什么呢？什么是CoinList，比如为什么要使用CoinList？你为什么就不能这么做？然后，也许我们可以转移到回答你开始谈论的问题，谁应该考虑做一个ICO，谁不应该？

\- Yeah, and just on terminology for folks that are newer to this space. I tend to use tokens, coins, cryptocurrencies all synonymously, cryptoassets even. Some people have slightly different definitions, I tend to use them all the same. And then ICO, token sale, kind of the same thing in my eyes. So those are generally synonymous. An ICO, or a token sale, is, ICO, initial coin offering, is when a new network is being created, and a company is issuing tokens for the first time, and its network is starting to distribute them. And they've run this token sale to do two things generally. One, to raise money for the future development of that network, and support that network in the long term. And two, to get early distribution of those tokens, because these networks like Filecoin only work if there are people who have it to store files, people who have it to give files to be stored, and kind of incentive alignment around that. So you need a way to distribute these tokens initially, one way to do so is to sell them. And so they go out and conduct these sales where they go and sell tokens to investors, or to users that want to eventually participate on the network.

\-是的，只是关于这个空间更新的人的术语。我倾向于使用令牌、硬币、加密货币-所有这些都是同义词，甚至是密码资产。有些人的定义略有不同，我倾向于使用它们。然后ICO，令牌销售，在我眼里也是一样的。所以这些通常是同义词。一个ICO，或一个令牌销售，是，ICO，首次发行硬币，当一个新的网络正在被创建，而一家公司第一次发行令牌，并且它的网络开始分发它们。他们经营这个令牌销售一般做两件事。第一，为该网络的未来发展筹集资金，并长期支持该网络。第二，得到这些令牌的早期分发，因为像Filecoin这样的网络只有当有人拥有它来存储文件，有它来存储文件的人才能工作，并且围绕着它进行某种激励一致。所以你需要一种最初分发这些令牌的方法，其中一种方法就是出售它们。所以他们出去进行销售，然后卖给投资者，或者是希望最终加入网络的用户。

\- And that's a case where the network literally does not work unless you have a token.

\-在这种情况下，除非您有令牌，否则网络实际上无法工作。

\- Yeah, that's exactly right. Filecoin is the first token sale that we supported at CoinList. They raised a staggering $205 million in their initial coin offering. We've worked with a number of other ones since, Blockstack, and PROPS, and Origin, Trust Token, and what CoinList does is for that small set of companies, we support the logistics of the token sale, so there's a bunch of compliance work you need to do, which is probably not worth getting into, but you'll hear these buzzwords, know your customer, KYC, anti-money laundering.

\-是的，完全正确.Filecoin是我们在CoinList支持的第一个令牌销售。他们在首次发行的硬币中筹集了惊人的2.05亿美元。从那以后，我们和很多其他的公司合作过，比如Block堆栈，道具，原产地，信任令牌，CoinList为那些小公司做的事情，我们支持令牌销售的后勤工作，所以你需要做大量的合规工作，这可能不值得进入，但是你会听到这些流行的话，了解你的客户，KYC，反洗钱。

\- You need lawyers to be involved.

\-你需要律师参与进来.

\- And we have many of them. And so we handle the compliance, we handle the transactions, so how the payments work, and money comes in, we handle the--

\-而且我们有很多所以我们处理合规，我们处理交易，那么付款是如何工作的，钱是如何进来的，我们处理-

\- You have to know how this is gonna work with the SEC, 'cause they're going to be, already are intimately involved, right?

\-你必须知道这将如何与证券交易委员会合作，因为他们已经密切相关了，对吗？

\- Lots of open regulatory questions, lots of closed regulatory questions, you need to know how to be able to answer correctly, and we support these companies through that process and then we'll market some of these deals publicly, or offer them to the investors on our platform to be able to invest in. We also offer other services, like that just compliance piece without the marketing as much we do for a broader set of token issuers, we have this whole other air drops product to give tokens away to users. So you'll start hearing this buzz word, air drops, more and more, I think. This is a way of giving, so we talked about ICOs being a way to fundraise and to distribute tokens to users. Sometimes you might not need to do the fundraising part and you might just want to distribute tokens to a wide set of users. How do you do that? Giveaway, and the first example of an air drop, I would argue, or one of the first, was Paypal, when they got started, and you sign up for Paypal, you get 10 bucks of Paypal credits Wasn't a token obviously, but they were saying, we've got a network, we need people to use this network, we just need to give them a little bit of money to get started, they can send some money, you send it to a friend, pay for something, and then they're gonna get really addicted and start to put more money in. And that's what an air drop is, it's a way of saying--

\-许多公开的监管问题，很多封闭的监管问题，你需要知道如何才能正确地回答，我们通过这个过程支持这些公司，然后我们会公开推销其中的一些交易，或者把它们提供给我们平台上的投资者，让他们能够投资。我们还提供其他服务，比如没有营销的遵从性部分，就像我们为更广泛的令牌发行者所做的那样，我们有整个其他空投产品将令牌分发给用户。所以你会开始听到这个嗡嗡的话，空气下降，越来越多，我想。这是一种捐赠方式，所以我们讨论了ICO是一种筹款和分发令牌给用户的方式。有时，您可能不需要执行筹款部分，您可能只想向广泛的用户分发令牌。你怎么做到的？我会说，空投的第一个例子就是Paypal，当他们开始工作的时候，你注册了Paypal，你得到10美元的Paypal的点数很明显不是一种令牌，但是他们说，我们有一个网络，我们需要人们使用这个网络，我们只需要给他们一点钱就可以开始了，他们你可以寄一些钱给朋友，付些钱，然后他们就会上瘾，开始投入更多的钱。这就是空投是什么，这是一种表达-

\- And it worked.

\-而且起了作用。

\- It totally worked.

\-完全成功了

\- It worked, totally worked.

\-成功了，完全成功了

\- You could give tokens away to people, they can start to use them on the network, and then hopefully they become such a fan of that network that they put more of their own capital in to use to it.

\-你可以把令牌送给人们，他们可以开始在网络上使用它们，然后希望他们成为这个网络的粉丝，把更多自己的资本投入到网络中去。

\- Who amongst Startup School world should think about tokens as a way to kickstart their network, to raise funds potentially, and who shouldn't?

\-在创业学校世界中，谁应该把令牌视为启动网络、筹集资金的一种方式，谁不应该这样做呢？

\- Yeah, so today, and this is again where I'd differentiate between today and tomorrow, or the future. Today, I think the most valuable applications of this technology are applications where you have parties that are not willing to trust each other. They're not willing to trust each other, they're not willing to trust a central intermediary either, and you need to build this trustless system. This does not describe a lot of businesses.

\-是的，所以今天，这也是我要区分今天和明天，或者未来的地方。今天，我认为这项技术最有价值的应用是那些不愿意相互信任的应用程序。他们不愿意互相信任，他们也不愿意信任一个中央中介，你需要建立这个不信任的系统。这并不能描述很多企业。

\- Where trust is somehow fundamental to the functioning of whatever product you're creating.

\-信任在某种程度上对你所创造的任何产品的运作都是至关重要的。

\- Exactly, so if we look at an example that I would say is not a great candidate for a token, there's possibilities, but not a great candidate, would be Airbnb. So on its face, you would say, this actually sounds pretty good, I want to stay somewhere, someone out there I've never met before has a home that I can stay in. I don't trust that person, I've never met them before, I've got no connection to them, but I do trust Airbnb. So you can have this intermediary, I have no problem trusting Airbnb, I stay in 'em all the time, and I say, alright if Airbnb's vetted them, and they're backing me up, they've got their insurance thing, they've got all this, no problem, I trust Airbnb, let's do it. That means not a great candidate for a token. But if you start to have systems where you don't trust even the intermediary, much less the person on the other side, that's where a token might be a good fit. And the reason I'm not giving you--

\-没错，如果我们看一个例子，我会说它不是一个很好的令牌，有可能，但不是一个伟大的候选人，将是Airbnb。所以从表面上看，你可能会说，这听起来很不错，我想呆在某个地方，一个我以前从未见过的人，有一个我可以住的家。我不相信那个人，我以前从未见过他们，我和他们没有任何关系，但我相信Airbnb。所以你可以有这个中介，我没有问题信任Airbnb，我一直都在他们里面，我说，如果Airbnb对他们进行审查，他们支持我，他们有他们的保险，他们有这些，没有问题，我相信Airbnb，让我们开始吧。这意味着不是一个很好的代名词候选人。但是，如果你开始建立一个连中间人都不信任的系统，更别说另一边的人了，这可能是一个很好的选择。我不给你的原因-

\- The Russian version of Airbnb, maybe you'd want a coin for that.

\-俄罗斯版的Airbnb，也许你想要一枚硬币

\- Totally possible, yeah, absolutely. And trust in institutions is fading, there's all sorts of research on this. Edelman puts out a great survey on trust every year, and so there is an idea that this could be more of a thing of the future. But the reason I'm not answering your question with just a slew of examples I can give you of, like, if your business fits this, do a token, if your business fits this, do a token, if your business, is because I just do not think there are that many today. And so it's more about finding these very specific use cases where it's particularly valuable to have a token than to try and fit into a category that could have a ton of tokens coming out of it.

\-完全有可能，是的，当然.人们对机构的信任正在减弱，人们对此进行了各种各样的研究。Edelman每年都会对信任进行一次很棒的调查，因此有一个想法认为，这可能是一件更重要的事情。但我不能用我能给你的一系列例子来回答你的问题，比如，如果你的业务符合这个要求，做一个令牌性的，如果你的生意，是因为我不认为今天有那么多。因此，更多的是要找到这些非常具体的用例，在这些用例中，拥有令牌尤其有价值，而不是尝试将大量令牌放入其中。

\- I want to save some time for questions, but just before we move on, you've talked in the past about pros and cons of tokens versus, say, convertibles of various kinds, like YC SAFE that probably most startups use to raise money, both from the perspective of a startup company and from an investor, maybe could we talk a little bit about those?

\-我想为问题留点时间，但就在我们向前看之前，你曾谈论过令牌的利弊，相对于各种类型的可转换债券，比如大多数初创公司用来筹集资金的YC保险箱，无论是从初创公司的角度还是从投资者的角度来看，或许我们能谈谈这些吗？

\- Yeah, so everyone in here, especially here in this class has done a lot of thinking about traditional financing and things like--

\-是的，所以在座的每个人，尤其是这个班的学生，都对传统的融资方式做了很多思考，比如-

\- Or you will, if you haven't.

\-或者你会的，如果你没有

\- Yes, absolutely, keep an eye out for those lectures. Things like investor protections, what rights do investors get, how do you have to deal with them? How do you fundraise for them? Do you sit down and talk to them, do you follow up, do you do a call? There's all these things that go into a traditional fundraiser, things we think about. With tokens, a lot of that is flipped on its head. So probably the biggest difference is that when you buy into a token, and this goes back to our original discussion of what a token is, the company does not control the network in this ideal form, they release this network, and it goes out into the wild, and you own tokens on that network, you own part of that network. But that means you have no formal relationship to the company as an investor in these tokens. And as a company, technically you have no formal relation to the investor that owns your tokens. And so there's this idea right now in startups of, we talked good and bad investors, like they may call you, they may check in, you've got an obligation to update them, you've got an obligation to get them to sign documents at certain times when transactions happen. When people buy into a token network released by a company, none of these obligations go, and there are pros and cons to that, certainly, on both sides of the equation. On the startup side, on one hand, way easier. These people don't have any stake in your business, you can do whatever you want with the company itself. There's no control that they have there. The downside of that is, they are not necessarily aligned with you. The upside of equity is that it's upside. When someone wins with equity, everyone wins with equity, in the general case, obviously there's some edge cases, but incentives are aligned, and that's awesome. With tokens, the incentives of the investors are not necessarily aligned with that of the company. So if the token is pumping up for some reason, and flying up the charts, an investor who invested a ton of money doesn't have any lockups on it, they may just swy, yeah, I'm getting out, I'm up to 10X right now, that seems totally worth it, I'm getting out, and they dump it, and it hurts the price, and it hurts the company by kind of second-order effect there. And so you get this kind of misalignment. You win because they don't have any stake in your company, but you lose because they don't have any stake in your company. And from the investor perspective, the exact flip side of that, which is, on one hand, you're not obligated to the company at all, you can do whatever you want, you just own tokens on a network that they've released. But the other side of that is that you might not get as much visibility into what's happening, you might not get those monthly updates, you might not be as engaged with the founders, you may have never met the founders. The idea in startup fundraising of raising from people that you've never met before does not really happen that much. Occasionally you see a little bit for certain things.

\-是的，当然，留意那些讲座。像投资者保护，投资者有什么权利，你如何处理他们？你是怎么为他们筹款的？你坐下来和他们谈谈吗？你跟进了吗？你打电话给他们了吗？在传统的募捐活动中，我们会考虑所有这些事情。有了令牌，很多东西就会被翻转在它的头上。所以，最大的区别可能是，当你购买一个令牌，这可以追溯到我们最初讨论的令牌是什么，公司并不以这种理想的形式控制网络，他们发布了这个网络，然后它就走入了野外，你在那个网络上拥有令牌，你就拥有了那个网络的一部分。但这意味着，作为这些令牌的投资者，你与公司没有正式关系。作为一家公司，从技术上讲，你与拥有你的代币的投资者没有正式的关系。所以现在初创公司里，我们谈论了好的和坏的投资者，比如他们可能打电话给你，他们可能会登记，你有义务更新他们，你有义务让他们在交易发生的特定时间签署文件。当人们购买一家公司发布的令牌网络时，所有这些义务都不会消失，这当然是双方都有其利与弊的。在创业方面，一方面，要容易得多。这些人与你的生意没有任何利害关系，你可以对公司自己做任何你想做的事。他们无法控制那里。这样做的缺点是，它们不一定与你保持一致。股票的好处在于它是向上的。当有人以公平取胜时，每个人都以公平取胜，在一般情况下，显然存在一些边缘情况，但激励措施是一致的，这是很棒的。有了令牌，投资者的激励不一定与公司的激励相一致。所以，如果因为某种原因，这个标记被放大了，而一个投资了一大笔钱的投资者却没有任何锁，他们可能就像SWY一样，是的，我现在就出来了，我现在已经达到了10倍，这似乎是完全值得的，我要走了，他们把它扔掉了，这会伤害到价格，也会对公司造成第二次订单效应的伤害。所以你就会出现这种失调。你赢是因为他们在你的公司没有任何利害关系，但你输了是因为他们在你的公司没有任何利益。从投资者的角度来看，它的另一面是，一方面，你对公司没有义务，你可以做任何你想做的事，你只是在一个网络上拥有他们发布的令牌。但另一方面，你可能对正在发生的事情没有那么多的关注，你可能没有得到每月的更新，你可能没有和创始人接触过，你可能从未见过创始人。从你从未见过的人那里筹集资金的想法并没有发生那么多。偶尔你会在某些事情上看到一点。

\- And you'd usually advise against it.

\-你通常会建议不要这样做.

\- Usually advise against it. In token world, many of these sales have had hundreds or thousands of investors that just signed up on the website. You know, CoinList facilitates this. People come and invest in sales where they have never met, talked to, chatted with the founders at all.

\-通常建议不要这样做。在令牌世界里，许多这样的销售已经有成百上千的投资者刚刚在网站上注册。你知道CoinList为这件事提供了便利。人们来投资销售，他们从来没有见过，交谈过，与创始人聊天。

\- You can go to CoinList right now and sign up for token sales.

\-你现在可以去CoinList注册令牌销售。

\- You certainly can, you can only participate if you're an accredited investor, unfortunately, site regulation sadly. But yes, you may have no relationship to the founders, again, pros and cons on both sides there.

\-你当然可以，只有当你是一个合格的投资者时，你才能参与，不幸的是，网站监管令人遗憾。但是的，你可能和创始人没有任何关系，同样，双方都有正反两方面的关系。

\- It's kind of amazing from an investor perspective, because if you invest in a startup company, usually before you see any return, it's a lot of time, five, 10 years, but with a token, if the token goes up tomorrow, you can invest and sell the next day.

\-从投资者的角度来看，这有点令人惊讶，因为如果你投资于一家初创公司，通常在你看到回报之前，这需要很多时间、5、10年，但如果是令牌的话，如果令牌明天上升，你可以在第二天投资并卖出。

\- Right, and I do think we are converging. Tokens, again, are young, I repeat this to myself alL the time, it's such a young industry. They are converging a little bit more towards venture capital. We're starting to see vesting schedules and lockups for investors, trying to get this incentive alignment a little bit tighter than kind of the freest version that I was just describing, and I think a lot of it's gonna converge that way. Early in the ICO market, companies raised once, they said we're gonna raise one monster token sale, that's gonna be it, we'll never need to fundraise again. More and more, we're seeing people talk about stage things that start to look a lot more like a traditional seed, series A, series B. And so it's gonna look more like venture capital in the future, I think, but there's still gonna be these key differences of what it is that you're buying and what that means for the relationships between the people involved.

\-对，我确实认为我们在会合。再一次，令牌是年轻的，我一直对我自己重复，这是一个如此年轻的行业。它们正向风险投资靠拢。我们开始看到投资者的归属时间表和锁定期，试图让这种激励机制比我刚才描述的最自由的版本更紧密一些，我认为其中很多东西都会以这种方式趋同。在ICO市场的早期，公司募集了一次资金，他们说我们将筹集一笔巨无霸的令牌销售，就这样，我们再也不需要筹集资金了。越来越多地，我们看到人们谈论的舞台上的东西开始看起来更像一个传统的种子，A系列，B系列，所以在未来它看起来会更像风险投资，我认为，但是你要购买的东西以及这对参与者之间的关系意味着什么，仍然会有一些关键的区别。

\- Awesome, so in the time remaining, if there's any questions on any of the topics we've talked about. Okay, right here, right in the front row.

\-太好了，在剩下的时间里，如果我们讨论过的任何话题都有问题的话。好的，就在这，就在前排。

\- [Male] I have two questions, one about venture investors. You said good investors, if you could share with us three pinpoints to account for good investors.

\-[男性]我有两个问题，一个是关于风险投资者的。你说的是好投资者，如果你能和我们分享三点来解释好投资者的话。

\- Okay, hang on there, we'll take each one in turn. What are the characteristics of good investors in your view?

\-好的，等一下，我们轮流拿在你看来，好投资者的特点是什么？

\- I'll talk about a couple characteristics, and then a way to find out. The characteristics that I think are really important for investors is, one, alignment with whatever your goals are as an entrepreneur. Not everyone's goals in this room are going to be exactly The same. Some people might be saying, for me, this is a $10 billion business or bust, that is it, that is all I'm going for, and I will always make the decision that leads towards that outcome. Others might say, listen, if I built a $10 million-a-year revenue business, I would be super happy and I'm looking for investors for that. If investors are not aligned with that goal, you're going to be in big trouble, because you will eventually make a decision that runs exactly counter to what they want. And so you need to make sure they're aligned with you on that. Second, how you interface with them. Is the interaction friendly? It can be intense, they may do diligence, there may be some real back and forth and firing back and forth, but do you walk away feeling good after your interaction with them? If you do not, that is not a good sign, because you are talking to them at a time when it's supposed to be really positive. You're talking about joining forces, a one-plus-one-equals-three situation, if you're walking away and saying, ah, this does not feel totally right, that's a really bad sign, 'cause at some point, in all likelihood, hate to break it to you, things will not go perfectly. And I'm not saying the business is gonna shut down or anything, but you will have a tough time at some point. And if an investor is not great when things are good, or you're talking about possible ways to work together and build something amazing, they will be really bad when things are going poorly. And so I'd watch out for those, those are kind of my two biggest things. The last one is, people argue about this all the time, but the idea of value add. I don't think every investor has to be some sort of crazy perfect, they're gonna make some amazing difference in your business, but if they're aligned, and you need capital, and they believe it's a good investment, that can be fine, you don't necessarily need someone that's going to do everything, but when you can find those investors, obviously that can make that introduction for you, give you that customer feedback, whatever it may be, recruit someone, that's tremendously valuable. The last thing I would say on that is that I think a super underrated part of fundraising is due diligence and reference checks on investors. So few people do this, but it is amazing. You talk to an investor, you're getting towards it, you're saying, Jeff, I think we've got a great relationship here, I'm really excited about working with you, I think we could do something amazing, and I would love to work with you as one of my investors, is it cool, can I talk to some people that you've invested in before? I just want to get a sense of your working style and kind of how we could work together in the future. Now, first of all, if they say no to that, really bad signal, right. Anytime someone says no to a reference check, bad signal. So they'll probably say yes, and talk to people that he sends you, maybe talk to a couple of other people that you know he's invested in that he didn't send you, and just ask them those questions. Because every founder that's had an investor can give you a very intuitive gut check on, yeah, Jeff's amazing, he was actually there, darkest days, things were tough, he came into the office, helped us figure out product strategy, this happened, that happened. And then you go back to him, and you say to him, Jeff, I'm even more excited now 'cause I talked to a bunch of these people, and they said you were so helpful in this, you were so helpful on that, let's make this happen. That's the most exciting way to close an investor conversation, highest chance of closing the money, and you've now set expectations around what you hope the relationship will be like. And so I would definitely do those calls, it takes time, but is worth it's for investors you're looking to work with.

\-我来谈谈几个特点，然后找出一个办法来找出答案.我认为对投资者来说真正重要的特点是，一是与你作为一名企业家的目标一致。不是每个人的目标都是完全一样的。有些人可能会说，对我来说，这是一项100亿美元的生意，就是这样，这就是我所要做的，我将永远做出决定，最终走向这个结果。其他人可能会说，听着，如果我建立了1，000万美元的年收入业务，我会非常高兴，我正在寻找投资者。如果投资者不支持这一目标，你将陷入大麻烦，因为你最终会做出一个与他们想要的完全相反的决定。所以你需要确保他们和你在这方面是一致的。第二，你如何与他们沟通。互动友好吗？它可以是强烈的，他们可能做勤奋，可能有一些真正的来回和射击来回，但你离开后，感觉良好后，你与他们的互动？如果你不这样做，那不是一个好的迹象，因为你是在与他们交谈的时候，它应该是真正积极的。你说的是联合力量，一加一等于三的情况，如果你走开说，啊，这感觉不完全正确，这是一个非常坏的迹象，因为在某个时候，很可能，不喜欢打破它，事情不会完美地进行。我不是说公司会倒闭什么的，但你总有一天会有困难的。如果一个投资者在事情好的时候不是很好，或者你在讨论可能的合作方式，创造一些令人惊奇的东西，当事情进展不好的时候，他们会非常糟糕。所以我会小心这些，这是我最大的两件事。最后一个问题是，人们一直在争论这个问题，但是关于增值的想法。我不认为每个投资者都必须是某种疯狂的完美投资者，他们会给你的业务带来一些惊人的变化，但如果他们联合起来，你需要资本，而且他们相信这是一项很好的投资，这可以很好，你不一定需要有人来做所有事情，但当你找到那些投资者时，很明显，这可以为你做介绍，给你那个客户。反馈，无论是什么，招募一个人，这是非常有价值的。对此，我要说的最后一件事是，我认为，对投资者的尽职调查和证明人调查是被低估的部分资金。这么少的人这么做，但这是令人惊奇的。你和一个投资者交谈，你会说，杰夫，我觉得我们在这里有很好的关系，我真的很兴奋能和你一起工作，我觉得我们可以做一些令人惊奇的事情，我很乐意作为我的投资者之一和你一起工作，我能和一些你以前投资过的人谈谈吗？我只想了解一下你的工作风格，以及我们今后如何合作。现在，首先，如果他们拒绝，非常坏的信号，对。无论什么时候有人对证明人说不，都是坏信号。所以他们可能会说是，和他派给你的人谈谈，或者和其他几个你知道他没有给你投资的人谈谈，然后问他们这些问题。因为每一位有投资者的创始人都能给你一个非常直观的直觉检查，是的，杰夫令人惊讶，他实际上在那里，最黑暗的日子里，事情很艰难，他来到办公室，帮助我们找到了产品策略，就这样发生了。然后你回到他身边，你对他说，杰夫，我现在更兴奋了，因为我和一群人谈过，他们说你在这方面很有帮助，让我们实现这一点。这是结束投资者谈话的最令人兴奋的方式，也是结束资金的最大机会，现在你已经对你希望的这种关系产生了期望。所以我肯定会打这些电话，这需要时间，但这对你希望与之合作的投资者来说是值得的。

\- So that was a solid gold answer. Please, please, please pay attention to Andy's wisdom there. Yes.

\-所以这是一个可靠的答案。请注意安迪的智慧。是

\- [Female] I am into watching crypto space, so given the nuclear winter that's occurring right now, is CoinList looking to pivot to support STOs, or are you going to stay on the ICO path?

\-[女性]我喜欢看隐秘空间，所以考虑到现在正在发生的核冬天，CoinList是在寻求支持STO，还是要继续走ICO的道路？

\- Okay, so the question is, given the nuclear winter in crypto-land, is CoinList looking to pivot to STOs or are you going to stick firmly with ICOs?

\-好的，所以问题是，考虑到核冬天在神秘的土地上，CoinList是希望转向STO，还是你将坚定地坚持ICO？

\- Yeah, so to unpack that a little bit, STO is a security token offering, and this goes back to what we were talking about before around the blockchain and token infrastructure being something that you can build a lot of different things on, one of those things that people talk about is what's commonly called a security token or an asset-backed token, and this is an idea of taking an existing asset, something that exists in the real world, the traditional world, maybe startup equity, maybe real estate, maybe gold bars, whatever it may be, and building a token that represents that asset. So one token equals one 1% of this building or this building's revenue streams, whatever it is. And the question is, are we looking to support those, where traditionally we've supported ICOs of these tokens that are more kind of token networks that only exist in the network itself and not in the actual real world.

\-是的，为了解开这个问题，STO是一种安全令牌服务，这可以追溯到我们之前所说的关于区块链和令牌基础设施的东西，您可以在这些基础设施上构建许多不同的东西，人们谈论的其中一件事情就是通常所说的安全令牌或资产支持令牌，这是一种采用一种现存的资产，存在于现实世界中的东西，传统世界中存在的东西，可能是创业股本，可能是房地产，也可能是金条，不管它是什么，并建造一个令牌资产的代名词。因此，一个令牌等于这座大楼的1%，或者这座建筑的收入来源，不管它是什么。问题是，我们是否希望支持那些传统上我们支持这些令牌的ICO，这些令牌是更多类型的令牌网络，只存在于网络本身，而不存在于实际的现实世界中。

\- And I guess you could do an ICO of an STO, it's a little--

\-我想你可以做一个STO的ICO，有点-

\- Totally, so that's where I would go on that is that we are certainly looking to support offerings of security tokens, we don't see that as a pivot. We actually see ourselves as just infrastructure to support sales of tokens. Thus far, they've happened to be what are commonly called protocol tokens, where they're these kind of network tokens and they function on these networks alone. If the tokens we're offering are asset-backed instead of network-backed, that makes no difference to us as the platform. We just have to figure out if it's a good fit for our investor base and if that can happen. But ultimately the process for running those sales is exactly the same.

实际上，我们认为自己只是支持令牌销售的基础设施。到目前为止，它们恰好是通常所说的协议令牌，它们是这类网络令牌，它们只在这些网络上工作。如果我们提供的令牌是资产支持的，而不是网络支持的，这对我们这个平台没有什么影响。我们只需要弄清楚，这是否适合我们的投资者基础，以及这是否可能发生。但最终这些销售的过程是完全一样的。

\- Awesome, yeah.

太棒了是的

\- [Male] Are tokens currency?

\-[男性]是货币吗？

\- Are tokens currency? Regulatory answer, totally depends. Practical answer, yes and no. In the kind of colloquial form of currency where you're using something to exchange for something else, absolutely, most of these tokens are some sort of object that fits into that category, some might not be. So one example, I often refer to Bitcoin's value as a store of value. And that means I'm really thinking of Bitcoin most analogous to digital gold. Gold is not a currency, you can use it to exchange for things, but it's not really great for that. It's more used to store value, put value into it, you can take value out of it, and that's how I see the value of Bitcoin. I don't think that's the same for every token. More of these tokens fall into that kind of exchange category. But from a regulatory stance, aside from the kind of colloquial definition, the answer largely is no to that. But in certain cases, maybe yes again depending on the exact characteristics and we can talk about specific examples there.

\-代币是货币吗？监管的答案完全取决于。实际答案是和不是。在一种口语化的货币形式中，你用某种东西来交换其他的东西，当然，这些标记中的大多数都是某种属于这类的东西，有些可能不是。举个例子，我经常把比特币的价值称为价值的储存。这意味着我真的在想比特币最类似于数字黄金。黄金不是一种货币，你可以用它来交换东西，但这并不是什么了不起的东西。它更多地用来存储价值，将价值投入其中，你可以从中提取价值，这就是我对比特币价值的看法。我不认为每个标记都是一样的。更多的这些令牌属于这种交换类别。但除了口头定义之外，除了监管立场之外，答案基本上是否定的。但在某些情况下，可能是的，可能再次取决于确切的特点，我们可以谈谈具体的例子。

\- And Bitcoin's complicated, because there's Bitcoin Cash, which is maybe a currency.

\-比特币很复杂，因为有比特币现金，这可能是一种货币。

\- Totally different token. So Bitcoin cash is--

\-完全不同的令牌所以比特币现金.

\- But it's a totally different currency, although, yeah, maybe that's too much. Yes.

\-但这是一种完全不同的货币，尽管，是的，也许那太多了.是

\- So I have a question. So if Airbnb started today, do you think it would be a right candidate for an ICO?

所以我有个问题那么，如果Airbnb今天启动，你认为它会是ICO的合适人选吗？

\- If Airbnb did?

\-如果Airbnb有？

\- Yeah, if Airbnb started--

\-是的，如果Airbnb开始-

\- So if Airbnb started today, would they be a good candidate for an ICO?

\-那么，如果Airbnb今天启动，他们会成为ICO的好候选人吗？

\- I don't think necessarily. Again, I go back to I trust Airbnb. I have no problem with that, and yes, I'll go forward and rent someone's house through Airbnb and be happy with that. There are arguments that it could be successful in that manner, because maybe it's less fees if there's less of a middleman. But Airbnb does provide valuable services to me as the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for those services. I don't feel like Airbnb is taking unreasonable fees on those transactions, because they provide a lot of services. And so do they need a network? I don't think they need one. Could it be an interesting service? Could it be a potentially competitive service? Absolutely, but if I were starting that business today, I wanted to connect homeowners or apartment owners to people that wanted to stay there, I would probably go the centralized route initially, but with an eye on the crypto space and seeing if there might be opportunities in the future. The last thing I would say on that is it is underrated today how hard it is to build these token networks, it is so hard. They're so young, the tooling is not there, development is incredibly challenging. Augur was really the first ICO that officially launched in a big way, three years from their ICO to launch and they just launched this summer, and the amount of work that went into that is unimaginable.

我觉得不一定再次，我回到我信任Airbnb。我对此没有异议，是的，我会通过Airbnb出租别人的房子，并对此感到满意。有人认为这样做是成功的，因为如果中间商不那么多的话，这可能是更少的费用。但Airbnb确实为我提供了有价值的服务，作为消费者，我愿意为这些服务付费。我不觉得Airbnb对这些交易收取不合理的费用，因为它们提供了大量的服务。那么他们需要一个网络吗？我觉得他们不需要。这会是一项有趣的服务吗？这会是一种潜在的竞争性服务吗？当然，但如果我今天开始做这个生意，我想把房主或公寓业主和那些想留在那里的人联系起来，我一开始可能会走集中的路线，但要注意隐秘的空间，看看未来是否会有机会。我要说的最后一件事是，今天人们低估了建立这些令牌网络的难度，这太难了。他们太年轻了，工具不在那里，开发是非常有挑战性的。AUGER是第一个以大的方式正式启动的ICO，从他们的ICO发布到发布已经有三年了，而他们今年夏天才刚刚启动，其中的工作量是难以想象的。

\- I mean you have to replace the human beings at Airbnb who are building the processes and infrastructure to make it a trusted network, right.

\-我的意思是，你必须取代Airbnb的人，他们正在建设流程和基础设施，使之成为一个值得信赖的网络，对吗？

\- With no precedent for how to build these things. And so, even that alone, you're looking at it as a business trying to raise as little money as possible and push forward with what you have, it's a tough move.

\-没有关于如何建造这些东西的先例。因此，即使仅凭这一点，你也会把它看作是一项业务，试图筹集尽可能少的资金，并把你所拥有的东西推向前进，这是一个艰难的举动。

\- But do you think it's fair to say that there's a faction of crypto world that says, central authority, bad, and we should replace all of those with a trusted network.

\-但是你认为公平地说有一个秘密世界的派系说，中央权威，不好，我们应该用一个可信的网络来取代所有的人。

\- Absolutely, and I think a lot of crypto has its roots in this anarcho-libertarian philosophy that I think was incredibly important for the early days of crypto, because that is one of its core use cases, this avoidance of middlemen, and driving the industry forward with that philosophy is incredibly important. But that's very different from looking at it from a really pragmatic business side. And there may be some crossover there, but it's not 100%.

\-当然，我认为很多密码都植根于这种无政府主义的自由主义哲学，我认为这对于密码的早期来说是极其重要的，因为这是密码的核心用例之一，这种对中间人的回避，以及用这种哲学推动行业向前发展是极其重要的。但这与从一个非常务实的商业角度来看它有很大的不同。可能有一些交叉，但不是100%。

\- Over there. One question at a time. 'Cause it's really fun to pile 'em on, but there's a lot of people who want to ask questions. So ask the one you really want answered first.

\-在那边一次一个问题。因为把它们堆起来真的很有趣，但是有很多人想问题，所以先问你真正想要回答的问题。

\- How do you distinguish between value and information?

\-你如何区分价值和信息？

\- Yeah, so it's a really important question. I think, at its core, you can represent value and information. So I can make online transactions with the internet without tokens and move value around, but what that's really doing is moving symbolic representations of value around, and directing different entities to move it. So when I make a payment with my credit card on the internet, sure, it is just information that is moving. I'm sending authorization codes, my CVV goes here, and this happens, but ultimately what happens is it goes to the credit card issuing entity and conveys them the information, Andy just spent $10 on this merchant, please debit $10, or put $10 on Andy's balance, and then merchant please, here are $10, you have now been paid for your services. What didn't happen there, the internet did not actually transmit that value. Those entities on either side pushed the value from one to the other. They may have done it over the bridge of the internet, but they were the ones that were maintaining the value. What's interesting with this token ecosystem is that the value is actually totally contained in the network. There are no entities that are actually holding that value for you. There's no credit card issuer that is keeping an eye on my balance and taking payments from me, and there's no bank on the other side that is holding on to the merchant's money. Instead, all the value is represented on the network, and people actually own that value. So I have my own keys on that network, I own those tokens, or I own the representation of those tokens, I'm not just owning information that gives me access to someone else owning that value. So at the end of the day, just a single-player example, in my bank account, it's my money, but it's not really my money, the bank has the money, and I just have information that allows me to access that money. In the world of tokens, I actually have ownership of that, those are my tokens, because I have the keys to access that, and no one else can do anything with it aside from me who has that access. And so when we talk about transmitting value as opposed to transmitting information, it's about direct interactions between nodes. I can pay Jeff with tokens, and it never touches a third party at all. Whereas with information, it requires those third parties, where you're informing them to move money between each other.

\-是啊，所以这是个很重要的问题.我认为，在它的核心，你可以代表价值和信息。所以我可以使用互联网进行在线交易，不需要标记，可以移动价值，但真正要做的是移动价值的符号表示，并指示不同的实体移动它。所以当我在网上用信用卡付款时，当然，只是信息在移动。我正在发送授权代码，我的CVV会在这里发生，但最终会发生的是，它会传递给信用卡发行实体并向他们传递信息，Andy刚刚花了10美元在这个商人身上，请把10美元借入10美元，或者把10美元放在Andy的余额上，然后请商人，这里是10美元，您现在已经为您的服务付费了。在那里没有发生的事情，互联网并没有真正传递这个价值。两边的这些实体将值从一个推送到另一个。他们可能是在互联网的桥梁上这么做的，但他们才是维护价值的人。这个令牌生态系统的有趣之处在于它的价值实际上完全包含在网络中。没有实体真正为您保存该值。没有信用卡发行人盯着我的余额，从我那里接受付款，也没有银行在另一边持有商人的钱。相反，所有的价值都表示在网络上，人们实际上拥有这个价值。所以我在那个网络上有我自己的密钥，我拥有那些令牌，或者我拥有这些令牌的表示，我不仅仅拥有让我访问其他拥有这个值的人的信息。最后，一个单人游戏的例子，在我的银行账户里，这是我的钱，但这不是我的钱，银行有钱，我有信息让我可以拿到这些钱。在令牌的世界里，我实际上拥有它的所有权，这些都是我的令牌，因为我有访问它的密钥，除了我之外，没有人能用它做任何事情。所以当我们谈论传递价值而不是传递信息时，它是关于节点之间的直接交互。我可以用代币支付杰夫，而且它根本不涉及第三方。然而，对于信息，它需要那些第三方，在那里，你要通知他们之间的资金转移。

\- Yes. So this is I guess more of a comment on the rigidity of networks, once you put them out there, it's hard to then go and change them, and upgrade them, and make them backward compatible to other things, do you agree with that?

\-是的。所以我想这是对网络僵化的一个更多的评论，一旦你把它们放到那里，就很难去改变它们，升级它们，使它们向后与其他事物兼容，你同意吗？

\- Yes and no. I think, again, early days, so there hasn't been a lot built around the upgradability of these networks, and once you put 'em out there, it's harder to make those changes, especially breaking changes. There's more and more infrastructure being built that supports that. It's something that I'm not incredibly concerned about in the future, it's something that feels inevitable that we'll get to a place where there networks can be easily upgraded. At the same time, it goes back to this idea, no company controls that network. And so they can't dictatorially make that change. If they make a change and the users on the network don't agree with it, the network will do what's called forking, we could talk for hours about this, where you get two different ones, and this is where the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash piece came in. You know, Facebook makes a change, I can't just make a new Facebook that goes back to the old change, that doesn't work, I don't have access to all of Facebook's infrastructure and code. In the crypto world, if, say, Protocol Labs made a change to Filecoin that people didn't like, it would be totally possible for people to start back right before that change happened, with the entire history of transactions with all the code, and make a new version of Filecoin, Filecoin Cash.

\-是和不是。我想，再一次，早期的时候，这些网络的可升级性并没有建立多少，一旦你把它们放到那里，就很难做出那些改变，尤其是那些破坏性的改变。有越来越多的基础设施正在建设，以支持这一点。这是我在未来不太关心的事情，这是不可避免的，我们会到达一个网络可以很容易升级的地方。同时，它回到了这个想法，没有公司控制这个网络。所以他们不能独裁地做出这种改变。如果他们做了一个改变，网络上的用户不同意，这个网络就会做所谓的分叉，我们可以用几个小时来讨论这个问题，在那里你可以得到两个不同的，这就是比特币/比特币现金的来源。你知道，Facebook做出了改变，我不能只做一个可以追溯到以前的改变的新Facebook，这是行不通的，我不能访问Facebook的所有基础设施和代码。在密码世界中，如果协议实验室对Filecoin做了人们不喜欢的更改，那么人们完全有可能在更改发生之前重新开始，使用所有代码进行交易的整个历史，并制作Filecoin的新版本Filecoin Cash。

\- And it's out of Protocol Lab's control.

\-而且这不属于礼宾实验室的控制范围.

\- Totally out their hands. So it's about, again, goes back to this incentive alignment thing that, sure, maybe someone can write to this version of the protocol and make changes to it, But they have to make sure that all the users are aligned from an incentive perspective to participate on that same network going forward instead of forking it off.

\-完全脱离他们的控制.所以，再一次，回到激励一致的问题上，当然，也许有人可以写这个版本的协议并对其进行修改，但是他们必须确保所有的用户都从激励的角度来参与到同一个网络的前进中，而不是分拆它。

\- Or not, because you can fork and then that fork is then backwards-compatible and the new one isn't or vice versa, and so maybe it's easier, because of the ability to fork.

\-或者不是，因为你可以叉子，然后那个叉子是向后兼容的，新的叉子不兼容，反之亦然，所以它可能更容易，因为叉子的能力。

\- Absolutely, yeah.

\-当然，是的.

\- More questions. Over there. Is it possible for someone who's a node, a person who's part of the network to propose a change that then gets incorporated into the network?

\-更多的问题。在那边作为一个节点的人，作为网络的一部分的人，是否有可能提出一个改变，然后将其合并到网络中呢？

\- Yeah, absolutely, so anyone, node or otherwise, can try to fork a network and create a new version of it with a change. There's, again, no special control that these companies have over these networks other than some sort of moral authority. Right, if they created the network, I probably trust them to be kind of the best stewards of that network and know how to build it, they're probably the biggest experts on it, 'cause they built it in the first place. So you're gonna probably go with their version until there's a reason not to. And as soon as there's a reason not to, which could either be because they do something bad or because someone else proposes something better. They could be going on a great path and making a great product, but if someone else, another node, anyone in this room says, I've got an improvement to Bitcoin, I think it's gonna be better than what the existing core developers are doing, I'm gonna propose that, I'm gonna align people around it and get people's attention around it, that could fork and be more successful and it's totally up to that person to do so.

\-是的，当然，所以任何人，无论是节点还是其他节点，都可以尝试发送一个网络，并通过更改创建一个新版本的网络。再一次，除了某种道德权威之外，这些公司对这些网络没有特殊的控制。是的，如果他们创造了这个网络，我可能相信他们是这个网络最好的管理者，并且知道如何建立它，他们可能是这个网络上最大的专家，因为他们首先建立了它。所以你可能会选择他们的版本，直到有理由不这么做。一旦有理由不这样做，这可能是因为他们做了坏事，或者是因为其他人提出了更好的建议。他们可能会走上一条很棒的道路，创造出一个伟大的产品，但是如果其他人，另一个节点，在这个房间里的任何人说，我对比特币有一个改进，我认为它会比现有的核心开发者所做的更好，我提议，我会让周围的人团结起来，让人们关注它，这可能会分叉，更成功，这完全取决于那个人这样做。

\- Let me argue that for a sec.

\-让我说一下。

\- Please.

\-求你了

\- Isn't it true that to really, these decisions become somewhat democratic, and so the network decides, but isn't it also true that these companies that do ICOs or they create a token tend to hold a significant portion of the currency for themselves, and therefore have the biggest voice on the network?

\-这不是真的吗，这些决定变得有点民主了，所以网络决定了，但是这些做ICO或者创建令牌的公司往往为自己持有很大一部分货币，因此在网络上拥有最大的声音，这不也是真的吗？

\- Yeah, so a couple things. One is when I'm answering these kind of high-level questions about crypto, I'm thinking purely of the very small set of good tokens. There are lots of bad actors out there that build in all sorts of weird ways to influence the network, but just talking about the kind of ideal of these tokens and blockchain networks, that's where we're going on these questions. Absolutely some of these issuers have significant stakes in the network. But a couple things happen, one, the voices are not always based on who has the biggest stake in the network. A really important voice is whoever is mining and this is a whole 'nother topic, but what the consensus mechanism is. So on Bitcoin, the Bitcoin core developers is a group of people that have access and can try and change the code of Bitcoin, but it has to be adopted by all the miners, which are these people running huge server farms doing work on the Bitcoin network. If those people choose not to adopt it, you can think of the Bitcoin core developers as being from the entity that created Bitcoin, which isn't really true in that case, because again created by pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, but the miners have the power there, not the people that are core developing it. And so it depends on, again, how the network makes its decisions.

是啊所以有几件事一种是，当我回答关于密码的高层次问题时，我纯粹是在想一组非常小的好标记。有很多不好的角色，他们以各种奇怪的方式影响网络，但仅仅是谈论这些标记和区块链网络的理想，这就是我们要讨论的问题。当然，其中一些发行人在该网络中拥有重大股份。但是有几件事发生了，第一，声音并不总是基于谁在网络中拥有最大的利害关系。一个真正重要的声音是谁在挖掘，这是一个完整的‘另一个话题，但共识机制是什么。所以在比特币上，比特币核心开发者是一群能够访问并试图改变比特币代码的人，但它必须被所有的矿工所采用，这些人在比特币网络上运行着巨大的服务器农场。如果这些人选择不采用比特币，你可以认为比特币核心开发者来自于比特币的创建者，在这种情况下这并不是真的，因为同样是由假名中本聪创造的，但矿商在那里拥有权力，而不是核心开发人员。因此，这同样取决于网络是如何做出决定的。

\- So it's complicated.

所以很复杂

\- It is complicated.

\-这很复杂。

\- Okay, a couple more questions, right there.

\-好吧，还有几个问题，就在这里

\- [Female] What developments to you expect to see in the ICO industry before ICOs become a viable path for more startups?

\-[女性]在ICO成为更多初创企业的可行途径之前，你希望看到ICO行业的哪些发展？

\- Yeah, so what developments would I expect to see in the ICO industry before they become a viable path for more startups? It really depends on, and again this goes back to, it's a really good question, what we mean by, so when we say ICO, we're talking about initial coin offering when we say coin or token, what are we talking about? And that's where it's so many different things. So what we've really been talking about here is a history of successful, or looking to be successful, protocol tokens, these tokens that are network-based that have this trust avoidance, or trustless networks. I don't think there's a world were every startup is going to need to do that. I trust my corner store to give me good food, I trust my gro-, you know, so that will always exist. And so I don't ever think that every company will need to do a token of that blend. But you can imagine a world, going back to the STO question, where there are tokens that represent company equity, and I am purchasing company equity via a token instead of some other document, an equity round, or a SAFE, or whatever it may be, and maybe there's an underlying SAFE below it, and there's a token that represents it. For that to happen, I think what we'll need to see is just a lot more infrastructure to be built out. There's reasons that that is a good idea to have these asset-backed tokens, things like increased access to liquidity. There's all these exchanges being built and liquidity pools for increased liquidity for these asset-backed tokens. They're interoperable with each other, so you can move 'em around more easily. I think, this is a trend Jeff and I have talked about before, generally the arc of venture capital bends towards increased liquidity and speed to liquidity, and these things come faster and faster. A little bit of a speed bump in recent years, but generally, I think, moving that way. And tokens will only continue that trend. So I do think as infrastructure gets built out, it may make sense for companies to raise equity with tokens that represent that equity. And that is not some sort of crazy ICO phenomenon where you'll be able to go out as a seed-stage startup and say, my token is worth $200 million, no it's gonna represent the equity, and it'll be worth what the equity's worth, maybe with some premium for the benefits of tokenization on top of it, but we need infrastructure there, and until that infrastructure exists, I don't think it's worthwhile except as maybe a proof of concept for people to show that it's possible, but we need more built there and hopefully that gets built in the upcoming months or years.

\-是的，在ICO行业成为更多初创企业的可行途径之前，我希望看到它们的发展？这取决于，再一次，这是一个很好的问题，我们的意思是，当我们说ICO时，我们说的是首次发行的硬币，当我们说硬币或令牌时，我们说的是什么？这里有很多不同的东西。所以我们在这里真正谈论的是一个成功的，或者希望成功的历史，协议令牌，这些基于网络的令牌，具有这种信任避免的，或者不信任的网络。我不认为世界上每一家初创公司都需要这样做。我相信我的街角商店会给我提供好的食物，我相信我的食物-你知道，所以它将永远存在。所以我从来没有想过每一家公司都需要做些什么。但是你可以想象一个世界，回到STO问题，那里有代表公司股权的令牌，我是通过一个令牌而不是其他文件来购买公司股权，一个股权轮，或者一个保险箱，或者其他什么东西，也许它下面有一个潜在的保险箱，还有一个代表它的令牌。为了实现这一目标，我认为我们需要看到的是建设更多的基础设施。拥有这些资产支持的代金券是个好主意，比如增加流动性。所有这些交易所和流动性池正在建设中，以增加这些资产支持的代币的流动性。它们是可以互操作的，所以你可以更容易地移动它们。我想，这是杰夫和我之前说过的一种趋势，一般来说，风险投资的弧形转向增加流动性和流动性的速度，而这些事情越来越快。最近几年有点减速，但总的来说，我认为是这样的。而代币只会继续这种趋势。因此，我确实认为，随着基础设施的建设，公司可能有必要用代表这些股权的令牌来筹集股权。这并不是一种疯狂的ico现象，在这种现象中，你可以作为一个种子阶段的初创公司，说，我的令牌价值2亿美元，不，它将代表股权，它的价值将与股票的价值一样，也许加上一些额外的额外收益，但我们需要那里的基础设施，在基础设施存在之前，我认为它是不存在的。值得的，除了可能是一个概念的证明，为人们表明，这是可能的，但我们需要更多的建设那里，并希望在未来的几个月或几年建成。

\- Great, one more question. Right here.

\-太好了，还有一个问题就在这儿。

\- [Male] Do you think the future's gonna be a handful of blockchain, or many, many hundreds, and why?

\-[男性]你认为未来会是一小撮区块链，还是很多，几百个，为什么？

\- Yeah, do I think the future's gonna be a handful of blockchains or hundreds of blockchains? And you know, I think it'll be a relatively small number of blockchains, but a relatively high number of tokens. And to explain that for just a minute here. Many of these token networks allow for other tokens to be issued on top of them. So the most common buzzword you'll hear, Ethereum, which is the second biggest cryptocurrency out there, has got a blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and they've created standards on top of Ethereum to issue other tokens on top of Ethereum and the one you'll hear tossed around a lot is an ERC-20 token. This is a token that is issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain, but represents something other than Ethereum, and its price is not necessarily correlated with that of Ethereum. I don't think there's a need for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of blockchains to exist, because they are a pain to maintain. You need all these users on it with different mechanisms for how they interact with each other, but I do think we're gonna have a world with a lot of different tokens. Maybe not as many as some people think, I'm not kind of a tokens for everything, but if we get to this world of asset-backed tokens where all of a sudden buildings can have tokens that represent their ownership, or companies can have tokens that represent their ownership, that's a lot of tokens that are possible out there, but they will not all have their own blockchains, they will likely be built on something like--

\-是的，我认为未来会是一小撮区块链还是几百个区块链？你知道，我认为这将是一个相对较少的区块链，但相对较多的令牌。在这里解释一下。许多这些令牌网络允许在这些令牌的基础上发出其他令牌。所以你会听到最常见的流行词，Etal um，它是世界上第二大的密码货币，它有一个区块链，Etalum区块链，他们已经在Etalum上面创建了标准，在Etalum上面发布其他令牌，而你会听到很多其他的令牌是ERC-20令牌。这是一个令牌，它是在Etalum区块链的顶部发布的，但是它代表的是其他东西，而它的价格不一定与Etalum的价格相关。我不认为有必要存在数以百计的区块链，因为它们是一个痛苦的维护。你需要所有这些用户使用不同的机制来处理他们之间的互动，但我确实认为我们会有一个有很多不同标记的世界。也许没有一些人想的那么多，我并不是什么东西的代金券，但是如果我们来到这个资产支持的代币世界，突然间建筑物可以有代表他们所有权的代币，或者公司可以有代表他们所有权的代币，这是很多有可能存在的代币，但它们并不都有自己的区块链，它们很可能是建立在这样的基础上的

\- Which will be very error-prone if they do, right, because it's all new code, and that's

\-如果他们这么做的话，就会很容易出错，对吧，因为这都是新代码，而且.

\- And you need a certain

\-你需要一个

\- All sorts of things

\-各种各样的事情

\- Kind of critical mass

\-某种临界质量

\- That could break.

\-这可能会打破.

\- For it to be safe and secure, and so maybe they'll all be on Ethereum, or Stellar, or one of these other networks. But lots of tokens, relatively few blockchains would be my prognostication. The last point I would make on that is, once again, we are less than a decade into crypto at all. We are less than five years into tokens beyond the very basic building blocks at all. That is the earliest, earliest days imaginable of this ecosystem and any prediction I make today stands probably a worse chance of being true than a good one. So who knows, we'll see in the coming decades.

\-为了让它安全可靠，也许它们都会出现在以太，恒星，或者其他网络中。但我的预言是，很多标记，相对较少的区块链。我要说的最后一点是，再一次，我们的密码还不到十年。我们还不到五年的时间，就已经超越了最基本的积木。这是这个生态系统最早、最早的时候，而我今天所作的任何预测，可能比一个好的生态系统更有可能成为真实的。所以谁知道呢，我们会在未来的几十年里看到。

\- And that's a great way to end, thank you very much for your time, Andy.

\-这是一个很好的结束方式，非常感谢你抽出时间，安迪.

\- Thank you, thank you guys.


谢谢你们
