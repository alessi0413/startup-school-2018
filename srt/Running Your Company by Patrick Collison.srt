1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:02,710
- So, Patrick, welcome.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,570
So Patrick is the co
founder and CEO of Stripe.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,500
He launched the startup or

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,680
now pretty big company in 2010 correct?

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,858
With his brother John.

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:15,050
- Well actually we started working on it

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,220
full time in 2010 but it actually,

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,700
to your comment just there
about companies launching,

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,800
it took us quite awhile to launch

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,280
'cause we had to get all
these banking partnerships

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,410
in place and so on and so we

12
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,467
didn't launch until September 2011.

13
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,300
And we'd been working
- Oh.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,769
- on it for almost two years at that point

15
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,690
and every time we saw
PG or really anyone else

16
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,780
from YC all they would ask us

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,388
is why we had not launched yet.

18
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:37,221
(Interviewer laughing)

19
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,604
So some things don't change.

20
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,150
(Interviewer laughing)

21
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,983
- That's interesting.

22
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,120
So two years until you had to--

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,651
- Yeah it was I think,
- practice.

24
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:47,630
- one year and 11 months from sort

25
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,073
of first line up code to public launch.

26
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,600
Which to be clear I don't recommend.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,573
That is not a good idea.

28
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,869
Just we had to because we had to

29
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:57,299
kind of get all these
other things in place

30
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,450
and because it sort of too us

31
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,720
so long to have publicly launched,

32
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,920
versus, we tried to be very disciplined

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
about sort of gradually expanding

34
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,870
the number of users every month

35
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,980
and so even though we
weren't publicly available,

36
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,750
we got our first user,
like first production user

37
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,350
just kind of freelancing
and then every month

38
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,480
we tried to add at least
kind of a handful of users

39
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,007
and so by then we publicly launched

40
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,280
and we did have about
100 users which I mean

41
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,360
back then to us seems, that's a big deal.

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,195
That's very large.

43
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:29,840
- Speaking of, actually
when I was preparing

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,940
for this interview I was
trying to jog my memories

45
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,080
and I remember specifically because

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,490
your office was near here in Palo Alto

47
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,050
and I remember back then people would

48
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,690
always talk about the Collison
brothers running around

49
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,528
going to peoples offices and
like installing their API

50
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:48,661
into the web apps and in true

51
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,540
do things don't scale a fashion.

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,230
And I assume you were not only trying

53
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,948
to make sure they installed
it but also get user feedback.

54
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,750
And it happens so much that actually,

55
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,180
I don't know if you know Paul Graham, PG,

56
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,408
now calls it the Collison Installation.

57
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,370
(laughing)

58
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,466
And this is actually something we give,

59
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,170
we tell our founders to go do this.

60
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,815
Do the Collison Installation
'cause obviously,

61
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:13,520
in the hindsight it
seems so obvious to do.

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,510
- Well it sort of serves two purposes.

63
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,730
One is your point.

64
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,619
It serves as a really
good way to kinda get,

65
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:22,190
to use research and to get
kind of UX feedback and so on

66
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,030
and I mean if you've done this I'm sure

67
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,061
you had the experience where,

68
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,970
you design what you're absolutely certain

69
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,840
is the most streamlined user friendly

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,290
straight forward frictionless
way to do whatever it is

71
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,060
the product does and then you kind of,

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,770
you plant it and kind of
put in front of a user

73
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,740
and you just kind of ask
them to do whatever it is

74
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,530
and they find it completely impenetrable

75
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,170
and like they're clicking
all the wrong links

76
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,980
and they can't find the net button

77
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,787
even though the next button is

78
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,245
there blinking in green and such.

79
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,525
And so it's invariably
sort of incredibly painful.

80
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,744
There's sort of nothing so sobering

81
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,440
as watching somebody use kind of

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,518
the first version of some new product.

83
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,120
But the other reason for us was,

84
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
we had suggested to
somebody they use Stripe

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,450
of they switch to Stripe whatever

86
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,790
and invariably their response is oh yeah,

87
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,330
sure that sounds awesome but it can be,

88
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,684
they'll postpone it,
they'll postpone it again.

89
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:12,517
Just like there's never a moment

90
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:14,027
where it's like okay this is the evening

91
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,170
where I'm going to switch to Stripe.

92
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,850
And so us going and sort

93
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,086
of accosting them in
person sort of helped,

94
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,460
he'll talk in sales it's always like

95
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,480
a why you and a why this and why now?

96
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,897
And these kind of questions.

97
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,150
And going in person kind of
created a why now moment.

98
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,423
It's like well we're here at your house.

99
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:35,490
- Did you just show up or how did you?

100
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,529
Like what--

101
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:37,890
- I don't think we ever
actually just showed up.

102
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,780
Although, perhaps we should've but no.

103
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,780
We tried to be kind of
at least semi invited.

104
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,533
- Got it.

105
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:50,900
So Stripe now today, I mean you've come

106
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,810
a long way since back then.

107
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,790
I mean it's not even been,
it's probably been a decade.

108
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,210
Not even.

109
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,310
But I mean today you're,
well you have 1300 employees

110
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,550
across nine offices across the world.

111
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,420
You're doing, I have a list here.

112
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,680
You manage 200 million API requests a day.

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,320
You process billions a year for millions

114
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
of companies across 130 companies.

115
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,320
Your latest round of fundings,

116
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,515
Stripe is now worth 20 million dollars.

117
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,410
(laughs)

118
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,130
Billion (laughs).

119
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,040
Anyway the list keeps
going on but I'm not gonna,

120
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,896
I'll stop there otherwise people

121
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,640
are gonna think I'm your PR agent.

122
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,149
But anyway, you've clearly
done something right.

123
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,690
And so I want to spend a lot of,

124
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,235
I guess the time today talking
about running your startup

125
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:37,573
from the perspective of the
startup CEO, you yourself.

126
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:40,310
And it's kind of like zoom.

127
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,930
Like what do you think
about from zooming in

128
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,470
on the day to day
operations to zooming out

129
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,413
to long term strategic decisions?

130
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,902
So maybe to help us ease
into the discussion,

131
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,570
one thing is when you start off,

132
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,720
when from the very beginning a lot

133
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,673
of friends get together and they come

134
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:57,506
up with an idea and they're super excited

135
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,390
and they start working on it and then

136
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,410
at some point they need to decide,

137
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,828
ah we need a CEO for
this company (laughs).

138
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:07,828
And some people aren't meant to be CEO's,

139
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,350
but for you and John,
I've met both of you.

140
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,350
You're very smart, ambitious
people with great qualities

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,950
that and attributes that correlate

142
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,430
to becoming a great leader.

143
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,900
How did you and John decide
you would be the CEO?

144
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,633
- Well, I think Stripe is unusual for,

145
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,550
John and I are obviously brothers.

146
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,510
We've known each other
for a long time and,

147
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,730
(audience laughs)

148
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,520
and because of the relationship,

149
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,823
we're able to place a lot
of trust in each other and,

150
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:43,564
we really do run the company together.

151
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,460
There's no major decision that sort

152
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,210
of Stripe has made that's sort of,

153
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,576
that we've not both been a part of.

154
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:55,587
And it's not always the
case that despite being

155
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,790
the CEO that I'm the person who like,

156
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,840
in the case of disagreement it's

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,980
not always the case that I prevail.

158
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,940
Sort of our kind of dispute
resolution framework

159
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,799
is kinda much more around
which of us cares more?

160
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,300
Than kind of which one of us

161
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,520
holds kind of this title or that.

162
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
I mean John's title is President.

163
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,803
It's, those kind of sound,
both are significant roles.

164
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:20,630
And so, yeah in that regard

165
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,000
I think we're kind of an anomaly.

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sort of the fact that I became
CEO was honestly semi random.

167
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,090
And I know it, yeah.

168
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,010
I think because we're brothers being

169
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,740
able to kind of get to
this unusual situation

170
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,127
where we really do run it together.

171
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:37,960
- Great.

172
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,180
Is there a certain--

173
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,466
- Wait, sorry.

174
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,299
It may not be a helpful answer

175
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:42,132
because perhaps you're trying to encourage

176
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,080
all these companies like shit.

177
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,030
One of you guys has
got to be the CEO but--

178
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,210
- Well, do you think there's
like a rubric for this

179
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,870
of here are five questions
you should answer?

180
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,113
Maybe then you decide.

181
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,700
- That's a good question.

182
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,853
Hm.

183
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,593
- Maybe not.

184
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,693
- Yeah, I'm guessing it's quite,

185
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,033
okay well here,

186
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,731
I was on one thing which I think

187
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:08,110
it is important just to
have an efficient mechanism

188
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,563
for reaching a decision
and it can't be sort of,

189
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,376
simply orange around consensus right?

190
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,064
If there's sort of three co-founders

191
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,364
and sort of none of you
sort of quite want to,

192
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,360
or nobodies a clear CEO and you don't

193
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,244
have some kind of efficient mechanism

194
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:27,830
for sort of having decisions get made,

195
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,490
I think that is a recipe for failure.

196
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,830
And even I don't know, doing some kind

197
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,260
of quasi democratic voting is

198
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,910
probably not a great idea either.

199
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,600
And so for myself with John we kind of

200
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,280
both have areas we kind of
respectively specialize in,

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,800
and so that doesn't mean we
kind of have absolute autonomy

202
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,620
and authority there but we
kind of bias in that direction.

203
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,230
So he spends more time figuring out

204
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,063
and working externally with users,

205
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,300
I spend more of my time working

206
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,060
sort of internally on a lot
of product engineering things.

207
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,760
That's not to say that
he doesn't make decisions

208
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,210
there or I don't here but again,

209
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,380
there's a bias in that direction

210
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,310
and then secondly we have
this kind of additional aspect

211
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,800
where in the case of it
being a major decision,

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,380
and we sort of respectively disagree,

213
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,503
then we really do sort of
try to make it based on

214
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,920
sort of which of us is just kinda,

215
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,250
is more passionate about it and because

216
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,600
that will correlate with the outcome.

217
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,300
One of us really wants to do something,

218
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,980
or things that X or Y is
the right thing to do.

219
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,260
Simply sort of wanting it to
be so passionately is more,

220
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,363
I mean that can be kind of

221
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:26,980
a sort of self fulfilling prophecy

222
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,450
and so I think it's kind of not irrational

223
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,150
to have that be a consideration.

224
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,443
- Yeah.

225
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,780
And I also see like the best teams

226
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,923
that work well together are
the ones in which everyone,

227
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,690
they all want the best idea to win,

228
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,399
not their idea to win.

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,101
- Definitely.

230
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:44,934
- And so there's a stepping back

231
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:49,934
in an unselfish kind of way
to get to that conclusion.

232
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,714
- Definitely and I think that something

233
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:56,146
that we're kind of lucky
about that I think is very,

234
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,710
well exactly to your point.

235
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,907
I think it is definitely present in sort

236
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,860
of the most successful
co-founding relationships

237
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,890
that I have seen is some degree of sort

238
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,999
of dispassion and disagreement and,

239
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,020
for us I think that was
kind of easier to get to

240
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,170
because we had been disagreeing

241
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,580
with each other for 20 years and so it had

242
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,200
lost some of the emotional charge,

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,110
but I think that sort of
finding other mechanisms

244
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,140
where by you can get there such

245
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,400
that it's not sort of this, I don't know,

246
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,770
this kinda, the notion
of disagreeing strongly

247
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,630
is not sort of a scary phenomenon

248
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,940
that kinda of both parties
or multiple parties

249
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,630
if there are more than two are kind

250
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,130
of suppressing their feelings for fear

251
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,270
of there being this divergence.

252
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,344
- You have, how many more
siblings do you have?

253
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,393
Do you have more brother?

254
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,010
- One more sibling yes.
- Okay.

255
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,843
- Three of us in total.

256
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,337
- Would you guys, would
he join the (laughs),

257
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,830
or is it just you and John are the,

258
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,750
that's a special match there?

259
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,240
- Well he, the, Tommy my youngest sibling

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,630
he's sort of quite a bit younger

261
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,380
than myself and John and so,
- Oh.

262
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,763
- John is almost,

263
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,983
or is approximately two
years younger than I am.

264
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:07,930
And when we started Stripe I guess

265
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,670
I was about 21 and I think,

266
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,614
I guess therefore John was 19.

267
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:15,730
And Tommy was still kind of definitively

268
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,150
mid way through high school and so,

269
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,258
- Ah.

270
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,091
- just wasn't quite practical at the time.

271
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:19,924
- Yes, finish high school.

272
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,000
And now I think if you asked him

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,980
he'd probably say he'd never throw

274
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,506
his lot in with miscreants like us.

275
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,310
- Yeah (laughs).

276
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,758
Cool.

277
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:28,591
So in terms of the role of CEO,

278
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:32,890
often people say there's a
threshold in time in which,

279
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,530
and it's related to product market fit

280
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,990
where you have a role as a
pre-product market fit CEO

281
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,700
and then which is completely different

282
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,613
in your role as a
post-product market fit CEO.

283
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,820
So I wanna spend up most of our time

284
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,137
talking about pre-product market fit but,

285
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,930
just to collaborate those questions,

286
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,950
what in terms for Stripe what

287
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,090
was product market fit for you?

288
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,330
Like how did you define it?

289
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,680
Were there metrics to it?

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,350
What number of employees were
you at when you reached it?

291
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,460
So and so forth.

292
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,400
- Yeah that's a really good question.

293
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,560
And I think you're exactly right

294
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,990
to kind of divide things in to
sort of like there's kind of,

295
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,690
the story of a startup is two stories.

296
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,710
It's a story of getting
to product market fit

297
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,770
and then the story of kind of what happens

298
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,560
subsequently and
obviously there isn't like

299
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,730
a totally definitive
binary line between them

300
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,810
but I think it's kind of helpful

301
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,913
to frame the narrative in that regard.

302
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,733
I know it's good for Stripe,

303
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,460
and actually around the
time we launched publicly

304
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,050
I think is basically when we had it

305
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,603
in that when we launched
publicly in September 2011,

306
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,980
we had kind of rebuilt
significant components of Stripe

307
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,120
kinda multiple times in
response to user feedback.

308
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,460
Like we're kind of on the
third version of our dashboard

309
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,969
and the second or third depending

310
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,210
on how you count major version of our API

311
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,690
and so we'd kind of gone through
a lot of iteration response

312
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,246
to kind of the evident
challenges that users had

313
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:53,220
or the deficiencies the
product seemed to possess.

314
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,503
And when we launched,

315
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,980
we were basically
immediately bottle necked

316
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,320
on sort of being able to serve user demand

317
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,170
rather than generating user demand.

318
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,365
And I think sort of
directionally that's kind of the,

319
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,640
the sort of, the inversion that happens

320
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,620
for sort of in the early
days you're sort of

321
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,910
trying to figure out well okay,

322
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,100
kind of conditioned on or given some user,

323
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
how do I make sure that
it does what they need

324
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,670
and they end up a happy retained user

325
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,654
in a sufficient fraction
of cases or whatever.

326
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:26,790
And then kind of at some
point it flips for okay,

327
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,650
this sort of, well, I think
it's kind of very different.

328
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,650
Do you sort of take 100
users and some fraction

329
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,910
of them on board and some smaller fraction

330
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,800
that remain engaged or
whatever and so kind of

331
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,810
100 users that curve sort
of accentuates downwards.

332
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,107
And then you take 100 users and kind of,

333
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,160
again a meaningful fraction end up engage

334
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,440
and they actually tell
more people about it

335
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,060
or they sort of invite people and

336
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,450
I don't mean kind of strictly
just in a viral sense,

337
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,920
but just kind of generally speaking.

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Just like kind of lead to and generate

339
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,223
more demand such as
things, you'd be sort of,

340
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:04,810
in some super linear
fashion kind of growing.

341
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,620
And I think when your sort of,

342
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,800
like being kind of less than one

343
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,280
is just very different to
being more than one (laughs).

344
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,380
And it sort of seems,
again when we launched,

345
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,210
I mean that didn't
generate that many users.

346
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,914
I mean I don't actually remember

347
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:19,530
but let's just pretend
that sort of 500 businesses

348
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,320
signed up on the day we launched,

349
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,530
but sort of immediately those sort of 500

350
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,530
businesses told other businesses

351
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,120
and people had heard
about it in all the rest.

352
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,620
So kind of, the next day we had a lot

353
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,650
of businesses as well and so forth.

354
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,090
Such that from the day we launched

355
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,720
the challenge became
keeping up with demand

356
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
rather than tweaking the product

357
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,640
to some how serve the market.

358
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,620
- When you launched how many

359
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,472
people were you at at that point please?

360
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,481
- We were about 10.

361
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:45,314
- 10, okay.

362
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:47,298
So, I guess before you launched then,

363
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,928
well your day to day
sounds like it was just,

364
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,840
like we were talking about earlier.

365
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,550
Just running around talking
with users and fixing issues.

366
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,279
Was that literally every
single day was it like that?

367
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,760
Or what were you doing everyday?

368
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,593
- Okay.

369
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:01,730
So not literally every single day

370
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,210
but I would say we really tried very hard

371
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,910
to sort of understand in
sort of very granular detail,

372
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:14,060
what exactly it was
that people were doing.

373
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,280
Where they were tripping up and so on.

374
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,260
So just to give you some examples,

375
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,620
we had a chat room for sort of

376
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,120
providing support when people
were integrating Stripe

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,990
and it was actually a public chat room

378
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,000
which kind of had some down sides

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
because if we'd broken something

380
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,650
or somebody had some kind
of embarrassing issues,

381
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,000
sort of everyone would see it.

382
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,781
We thought that was kind of good

383
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,075
because it would actually
kind of put more pressure

384
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,640
on us to sort of have the product be good.

385
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,570
And we had literally every time sort

386
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,770
for the first I don't know,
call it 10 users of Stripe,

387
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,303
every time somebody sent
an API request to Stripe,

388
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,970
like it sent an email to us.

389
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,860
So we were like looking at

390
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,056
every single API request (laughs).

391
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,860
And if we saw users do something weird

392
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,400
we'd be like well why
did they do that right?

393
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Or kind of where were our
docs confusing or whatever

394
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,550
and so I'd go to dinner in

395
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,480
the evening or something and I've,

396
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,860
well again it seemed
like a lot at the time.

397
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,330
Id have maybe 10 emails because Stripe

398
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,370
was not handling a lot of the API

399
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,693
requests back then but sort of,

400
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:10,420
you're literally looking at
sort of each individual action.

401
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,960
And actually Stripe, we
just kind of celebrated

402
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,440
or at least in the passed,

403
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,010
we're not very good at
celebrating but we passed

404
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,963
our seven year anniversary
just a few days ago.

405
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:25,200
On September 29th and so I
was looking at our sort of,

406
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,900
we had an hourly stats
email that we used to send

407
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,715
and so on the day we launched we handled

408
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:34,800
sort of 22 payments in the previous hour

409
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,090
and which again sort of
seemed huge to us back then.

410
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,320
But I was noticing in that email,

411
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,810
I'd actually forgetting this
that we had things like,

412
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,430
in the email we literally had a list

413
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,776
of businesses that had submitted three

414
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:48,096
or five or something API requests

415
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,760
but it'd sort of not gone live.

416
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,757
They'd not launched their businesses.

417
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,287
We literally just had the
emails of all these businesses.

418
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,270
The idea was that we would then kind of,

419
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,361
we would literally individually

420
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,194
reach out to them as like hey,

421
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:01,820
you kind of seem to use Stripe
a little bit but you didn't,

422
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,770
you didn't go live.

423
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,770
Like did we screw up or was the prodcut

424
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,587
somehow inadequate or whatever?

425
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:08,560
We did things like every time anyone

426
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,530
ever hit an error of any sort,

427
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,930
that generated like a
high priority email to us.

428
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,928
And so we'd sort of try
to immediately go solve it

429
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,900
and that also kind of generated sort of

430
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,580
I think this pleasant
kind of user experience

431
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,890
where I mean it's frustrating when

432
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,250
you hit an error in some service.

433
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,910
But we could then often
sort of 15 minutes later

434
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,504
reach out to them and say hey,

435
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,530
we saw that you encountered this problem.

436
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,900
It's all fixed now.

437
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,980
And sometimes we did that even

438
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,360
in the case where sort of the
users made a silly mistake

439
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
and they'd kind of mistyped
an API parameter or something

440
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,990
and we'd just reach out
to them and be like hey,

441
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,031
noticed you had a typo in your code.

442
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,750
Which perhaps to some of them was

443
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,368
a little bit unsettling but,

444
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:48,938
at least kind of helped us increase

445
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:51,385
the kind of the throughput
product feedback.

446
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,444
But so, I mean these are all kind

447
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,560
of examples I'd say of the
sort of general pattern

448
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,620
of sort of really trying to be kind

449
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,360
of hyper attentive to
all of the micro details

450
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,140
of sort of how people
were doing the product

451
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,360
and kind of iterating
rapidly in response to it.

452
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,950
And generally speaking I think that sort

453
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,310
of pre-product market fit metrics

454
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,010
are actually relatively unhelpful.

455
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,760
I think you sort of,
you really want to bias

456
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,170
very strongly towards
kind of as much inspection

457
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,900
and kind of high throughput
qualitative feedback as possible

458
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,240
because probably not that many

459
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,790
people are using their product right?

460
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,350
And so, if it's 20 users you can kind of

461
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,590
in some sense afford to just like

462
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,640
look at everything they're doing

463
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,525
and try to understand kind of
what's working, what isn't?

464
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,250
- Yeah in some sense
it's how much do they,

465
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,500
you can tell subjectively like how much

466
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,310
they love your product
or how much are they

467
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,375
gonna probably be really
upset if it just disappears.

468
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,040
- Totally and actually
this point we had a thing

469
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,870
at the bottom of every webpage.

470
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,250
We had a little sort of text box

471
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,732
kind of anchorage to the
bottom of the sort of,

472
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:56,443
of the browser frame and sort of,

473
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:00,190
kind of one line high sort of text input.

474
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,400
But we had placeholder texts in it

475
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,580
to sort of try to prime people

476
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,949
to sort of try and tell us things.

477
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:09,410
And so it had, my favorite part of Stripe

478
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,277
is ellipses and people just
fill it out and can hit enter.

479
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,910
But we also of course had,

480
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,990
most of the problems were negative.

481
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,380
It was like the worst
thing about Stripe is

482
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,670
or the worst thing about this page is,

483
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,560
or I really hate the way
Stripe does or whatever

484
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,280
and again we would sort of,

485
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,390
sort of at that stage you
have to be kind of masochistic

486
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,380
and so again we'd be
sort of always waking up

487
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,970
to all these emails telling us

488
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,780
about all the terrible
things about Stripe.

489
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,890
But that was a sort of helpful
to do list for the day ahead.

490
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,302
- How did you stay happy if,

491
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,135
(audience laughs)

492
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:40,968
like in the early days I mean

493
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,321
before I reached the top it's

494
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,154
like I have all these complaints.

495
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:43,987
- What makes you think we did (laughs)?

496
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:44,960
(audience laughs)

497
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,550
So,

498
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,090
it was,

499
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,220
I would say it was,

500
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,427
well happy is such a
squishy concept right?

501
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:52,440
(audience laughs)

502
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,347
And 'cause like, there are
lots of things that we,

503
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:59,459
or I guess, when I look back and look,

504
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,441
maybe this is the
rationalization I taught myself

505
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,270
but when I look back
at sort of through life

506
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,073
at the things that I'm
sort of most glad I did,

507
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,470
I wasn't exactly happy while doing them.

508
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,860
Like often I was very stressed out

509
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,280
or I had to work really hard or whatever

510
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,276
but they're the things
that kind of post hoc

511
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,200
brought the most fulfillment.

512
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,033
And,

513
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,400
and I think that,

514
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,103
well I mean a part of it.

515
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:24,936
There's a rich literature here and

516
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,330
so I don't wanna kind of
dive too deeply into it

517
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,301
but I do think kind of
happiness is a tricky concept

518
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,387
to kind of pin down because is

519
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,210
it kind of happiness in the moment?

520
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,370
Is it sort of the sense that you have

521
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,597
a year later looking back and so on?

522
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,660
And so I think language is squishy

523
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,150
and it's not completely
specifically defined,

524
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,570
but I think kind of generally speaking

525
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,780
kind of a better utility function

526
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,712
and kind of gradient to try

527
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,167
to climb is that of fulfillment.

528
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:51,580
And so I would say kind of the experience

529
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,920
of doing Stripe was, it
was not especially happy

530
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,210
because we were sort of constantly sort of

531
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,870
incredibly aware of all the ways in which

532
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,510
the product was severely deficient

533
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,300
and all the challenges we faced

534
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,702
and I mean it seems sort of,

535
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,330
I mean there was no
Fin-Tack category back then.

536
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,730
It was just like two teenagers
or just over teenagers

537
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,368
trying to compete with PayPal which,

538
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:15,590
many people told us was not an especially

539
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,773
kind of promising avenue to pursue.

540
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,910
And so not especially happy per say

541
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,862
but it did feel kind of fulfilling.

542
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,800
Like I enjoyed working with John

543
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,914
and the kind of people we hired.

544
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:31,570
It was really fun
working with the kinds of

545
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,300
kinda customers we were serving,

546
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,870
they were just sort of business doing

547
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,972
all these kind of wonderful things

548
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,310
and they were kind of really smart people.

549
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,820
And it felt that like,
if it worked it could

550
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,070
be kind of consequential in the world.

551
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,200
And so I would say kind of,

552
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,910
it sort of felt like I mean, well,

553
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,090
I don't know what it feels like to be

554
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,180
sort of a scientist or something

555
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,720
but I'm guessing when
you're sort of pursuing all,

556
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,010
you have this kind of big question

557
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,650
and you're pursuing all
these kind of avenues

558
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,860
to sort of try to better understand it

559
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,119
and I'm guessing day to day it's sort

560
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,013
of not especially happy because

561
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:04,073
most of your experiments
don't work or whatever.

562
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:06,910
But sort of in, perhaps
there's some analog there

563
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,150
in terms of it still feels
in some sense meaningful.

564
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,640
- Yeah there, in some sense.

565
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
I mean day to day like you said,

566
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,940
you're just running around
with your head cut off,

567
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,990
but maybe on a weekly or
at least monthly basis

568
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,940
is just taking a step
back and seeing like,

569
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,811
what progress have I actually made?

570
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,793
'Cause week to week it's like 1% here,

571
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,600
1% here, it doesn't seem much

572
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,270
but from a monthly basis or,

573
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,640
maybe longer than that it
seems like there's movement.

574
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
- Yeah and I think
that's true and I think,

575
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,860
I don't want to, like I
think it's almost certainly

576
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,530
a bad idea to sort of work on a company

577
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,330
or to work on anything if you're like

578
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,560
truly unhappy working

579
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,440
at it right?
- Yes.

580
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,340
- And so there's kind of clearly
some balancing act there.

581
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,560
And I think, I mean a lot of,

582
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,338
well there's sort of so
many different sort of

583
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:55,700
difficult judgment calls
to try to make a startup

584
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,613
but of course part of it is like,

585
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,570
is something is making you unhappy

586
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,990
or if it just doesn't
seem like an especially

587
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,170
promising avenue or it's not
really working or whatever,

588
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,230
like your time has relatively
high opportunity costs.

589
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,350
Like you don't get to start that

590
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,660
many startups in your life right?

591
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,780
And so kind of knowing when to kind

592
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,450
of sort of call it quits
is I think actually,

593
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,620
I mean sort in startup dom we really extol

594
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,070
and to uphold the virtues and sort

595
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,720
of determination at all costs.

596
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,997
Never quit and so on.

597
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:27,900
And that's clearly not the right answer.

598
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,370
And like sometimes you should quit.

599
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,800
And so, so I think kind
of what you're getting at

600
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,363
is true and right or I
think there does need

601
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:37,666
to be sort of some happiness,

602
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,301
satisfaction fulfillment.

603
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,500
There's a good book of that name,

604
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,847
Satisfaction which I recommend.

605
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:46,210
Kind of week to week, month to month if

606
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,489
you're on the right trajectory.

607
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:51,215
- Oh man, I wish I had
known that I could've,

608
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:54,010
I remember when I was trying to,

609
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,300
when I was about to, but Stripe myself,

610
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,760
I had these bad memories of trying

611
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,380
to implement PayPal and
like stacks of documentation

612
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,100
and taking like five days
to figure it all out.

613
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,740
And so I sat down and like it's,

614
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,480
'cause you guys are saying
go it'd take you 10 minutes.

615
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,860
I was like no way.

616
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,550
And it probably took me actually
five minutes at that point,

617
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,090
and I was super happy.

618
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,120
I mean that's like, but,

619
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,994
maybe I should've sent you a review.

620
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:20,310
(Patrick laughs)

621
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,143
(Interviewer laughs)

622
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:21,976
- Yeah I mean that would've been great

623
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:24,441
especially if the review had
sort of criticism for us.

624
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,274
(Interviewer laughs)

625
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,210
- But no it was--
- It was really easy.

626
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,620
- It's definitely helpful
to have competitors

627
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,750
with not very good products.

628
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,583
- Yes (laughs).

629
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,270
Okay so, you were, in the early days

630
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,950
you were doing a lot of stuff yourself.

631
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,770
At some point, I guess two part question.

632
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,030
One is what were the things that

633
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,310
you weren't go do at and then two,

634
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,485
at what point did you hire someone to,

635
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:49,463
what I assume is to do those things?

636
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,810
- Well I mean, I'm not that
good at most things right?

637
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,091
And I say this in a non
sort of false modesty or,

638
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,280
I don't mean to be kind of
artificially self deprecating

639
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,020
but sort of for almost
anything that Stripe

640
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,778
has to do there are sort of people

641
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:10,350
who are better at that than I am.

642
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,820
And so I think to some
degree sort of the story of

643
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,510
say product market fit and to say kind of

644
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,083
our current stage is kind of,

645
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,490
implementing the recognition of that

646
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,053
in kind of more and more areas.

647
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,060
That said, I think maybe sort of embedded

648
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,230
in that question is okay well,

649
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,180
acknowledging that you're probably not,

650
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,657
that you're probably not the worlds expert

651
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:40,250
in any single thing it's
kind of in what order

652
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,070
do you sort of replace yourself?

653
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,413
And for Stripe the sort of,

654
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,620
the important thing we were sort of

655
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:50,780
most obviously not that great at

656
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,346
was kind of partnerships and sort of

657
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:55,518
working with the various
banks that we have

658
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:57,730
to sort of get on board and so on.

659
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,830
And so kind of we made,

660
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,830
in fact Jeff Ralston who
is here in the room today,

661
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,780
I think sort of was some combination

662
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,740
of sort of very supportive

663
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,060
and perhaps in the back of his mind

664
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,598
was sort of slightly pitying where

665
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,640
he saw us kind of trying
to get these partnerships

666
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,920
with these kind of big banks in place

667
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,540
and we really weren't sort of
getting anywhere very fast.

668
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,810
And so he told us that we had

669
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,570
to hire this guy Billy
Alveratto and I told just,

670
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,403
don't ask me questions.

671
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,677
Just hire this guy.

672
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:32,095
(audience laughs)

673
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:36,155
And at the time everyone
at Stripe was an engineer

674
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:38,170
and so we just we kinda
couldn't quite understand

675
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,292
what a non engineer would do.

676
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,097
(audience laughs)

677
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,263
Like if you're not writing
code what else is there?

678
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,850
And so we were kind of suspicious

679
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,177
or this idea and we sort
of we went back to Jeff

680
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:51,140
and we met Billy and he
seemed like a wonderful guy.

681
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,450
We really liked him but we
couldn't quite get past this,

682
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,150
okay but like but what does that actually,

683
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,147
how does this workout in practice?

684
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:57,980
And so Jeff told us that we

685
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,260
should hire Billy and if it didn't work,

686
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,670
or if the first few months or whatever,

687
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,720
then if it didn't work out Jeff

688
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,380
would sort of go back and pay his salary.

689
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,630
So it was this kind of
zero risk move for us.

690
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:11,640
And so, and we didn't
have a whole lot of money

691
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,763
at the time so that was not insignificant.

692
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,960
So, we hired Billy and that was sort

693
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,120
of an immediately
trajectory changing event

694
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
where previously when we'd gone

695
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,540
and talked to a bank I mean I don't know

696
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,556
if they're literally doing
this but it certainly

697
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,023
it felt they were kind of pushing

698
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:26,856
this security button under their desk.

699
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:27,856
Like why are these guys in my office?

700
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:28,820
(audience laughs)

701
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,040
And then suddenly things started to go

702
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,390
kind of much more smoothly.

703
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,760
And Billy is still with Stripe today

704
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,550
and has been an enormously
kind of pivotal presence.

705
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,970
And so that was, turned out
to be very helpful advice.

706
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,890
- That is interesting.

707
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,520
Jeff as an inflection point for Stripe.

708
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,930
Never knew.

709
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,016
Cool.

710
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,554
So it sounds like you had hired

711
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,004
actually people before Billy.

712
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,310
I guess your very first hire,
the third person between,

713
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,670
with you and John was an
engineer I'm assuming?

714
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,503
Like--

715
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:02,890
- Well he actually wasn't an engineer.

716
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,028
But he joined Stripe and he
started to become an engineer.

717
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:07,861
(laughs)

718
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:10,080
So, like he'd written a little bit

719
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,000
of code previously but he joined

720
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,020
and there was a lot of code
that had to be written.

721
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,860
It was a guy I know from college.

722
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,513
He's actually also Irish and,

723
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,220
yeah but we had a lot
of code to be written

724
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,150
and so he was the kind of person who

725
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,390
would sort of survey the landscape

726
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,986
and just do whatever it was,

727
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,950
was most important and required.

728
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,290
At that time it was writing code.

729
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,743
And so, off he went.

730
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:37,860
- So kind of the transition
from pre-product market fit

731
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,513
to post-product market fit,

732
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:41,950
a lot of CEO's when they think back,

733
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,350
this is like the one point in which

734
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,240
they think aw, I could've
done that better.

735
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,142
So, how did you grade your
success of that transition?

736
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:52,450
'Cause of a lot of it
is just taking stuff,

737
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,400
delegating stuff better and doing

738
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,930
other functions of the business.

739
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,140
So, what exactly was
your transition like and,

740
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,460
how would you, how could I
if I was going in your shoes

741
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,200
tell that I was doing it well?

742
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,140
- Yeah so I don't think
I did it especially well.

743
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,890
I mean I think kind of
fortunately sort of it worked out

744
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,810
but I think if I was
doing it all over again

745
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,540
I think we could've sort
of accelerated ourselves

746
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,110
by a year or two if we'd sort of

747
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,800
gone about it in a
somewhat more disciplined

748
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,350
and kind of self aware fashion.

749
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,074
I think the, I think one
of those kind of pernicious

750
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,492
sort of mental models you
can have here is the kind of,

751
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,680
you are on some growth curve and it is

752
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,680
sort of your job to sustain
or marginally inflect

753
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,400
upwards or kind of somehow,

754
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,340
you know that, what's that?

755
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,979
Is curling the sport where
you're kind of wiping the ice

756
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:52,850
while the whatever it is the
weight proceeds down the line?

757
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,798
Sorry I'm not Canadian but,

758
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,940
and but kind of somehow you're kind of

759
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,820
making kind of these
very small interventions

760
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,440
and perturbations on some kind
of underlying growth curve.

761
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,290
I think that's an easy
mental model to have

762
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,380
and I think it's kind of actively

763
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,000
kind of fallacious and mistaken.

764
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,660
I think that a much better mental model

765
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,690
to have is you're serving some market

766
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,770
and the market is I mean for,

767
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,341
it's relatively finite in size.

768
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,520
I mean you can always change the crutch

769
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,210
and increase the market size but sort of,

770
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,510
you can think of it as being finite.

771
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,180
And then there's sort of the percentage

772
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,830
of the market that you're serving.

773
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,080
And then whatever percentage
you are not serving

774
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,060
is kind of well you just
haven't built the sort of,

775
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,550
go to market functions and organization

776
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,480
that's kind of capable or at least

777
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,450
has yet sort of brought the product

778
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,320
to those market segments and they kind of,

779
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,980
the growth curve or adoption curve

780
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,790
is just kind of a function of
that go to market apparatus

781
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,610
but basically it's not some
kind of cosmic trajectory.

782
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,095
It's something kind of very much

783
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:53,630
of your creation and under your control.

784
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,765
And so what I, what we did
not do but wish we did,

785
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:59,470
is kind of maybe, well whatever.

786
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,580
Just after we launched we,

787
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,240
there's a whole bunch of kind
of immediate scaling work

788
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,840
we had to do but say
six months after launch,

789
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,340
we should've sort of mapped out the kind

790
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,550
of concentric circles of our market,

791
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,350
like maybe those kind of
very early stage startups

792
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,750
that were kind of our sort
of initial constituency.

793
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,490
Then those kind of all technical startups

794
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,590
but not necessarily very early stage

795
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,598
and then there was kind of, I don't know,

796
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,889
you keep going these kind
of success increments

797
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,482
until eventually you
get to say all companies

798
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:28,070
handling online payments
or something right?

799
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,940
And gone and sort of figured out

800
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,760
okay, kind of what's
the size of this market?

801
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,580
Sort of, kind of what fraction
are we currently serving?

802
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,710
What would it take to
serve more and so on?

803
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,860
And I think it's quite striking

804
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,823
you see that when kind of repeat founders

805
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,420
kind of go and start companies,

806
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,270
they almost invariably are willing

807
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,490
to kind of build the organization
post-product market fit.

808
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,426
So it's invariably willing to kind

809
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:52,480
of build the organization ahead
of where things are today.

810
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,810
Which I think is exactly
the right thing to do

811
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,120
because they're thinking okay,

812
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,510
I have the right product.

813
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,160
Now let's kind of work
backwards from okay,

814
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,490
what would the organization look like

815
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,580
that was serving the
entire market and let's

816
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,670
just start building that organization

817
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,870
because again the growth
curve is under my control.

818
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,230
And of course it's not like
100% under your control

819
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,700
but I think it's much
more under your control

820
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,650
then some people tend to think.

821
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,120
There's also of course a difference here,

822
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
a major difference when you,

823
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,670
I think you have sort of a consumer versus

824
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,157
kind of B2B use cases.

825
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,850
For consumer it's a bit more I mean,

826
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,640
people don't necessarily
know exactly what they want.

827
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,990
Once the market size for
like a news reading app

828
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,805
or a dating app or something.

829
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,350
I mean it's, it kind of, it
depends a lot on the products.

830
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,241
Like maybe way more people

831
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,450
should be reading news or something.

832
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,930
But for sort of a, some service or product

833
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,337
that sort of serves a discreet
logical concrete function,

834
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:45,820
that's sort of a set of
businesses or entities

835
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,120
definitely have or don't have I think

836
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,980
it's kind of much more rational
and much more mappable.

837
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,710
And I partly had this epiphany when,

838
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,090
Aaron Levie who's the CEO of Box,

839
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,100
John and I eventually,

840
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,350
we sort of had done Polo Alto.

841
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,670
We moved up to San Francisco.

842
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,349
I don't, well Aaron Levie
had Facebook messaged John

843
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:10,030
and we'd never heard of
him and we hadn't heard

844
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,510
of most people in Silicon Valley.

845
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,530
But he'd Facebook massaged
us like very early on

846
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,368
asking to invest in Stripe.

847
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:16,970
And I think John didn't know.

848
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,870
Who's this random guy?

849
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,870
And so we never replied and
but then we heard of Box

850
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,830
and we heard of Aaron and
we read his funny Tweets

851
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,940
and all the rest and so
we moved to San Francisco

852
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,130
and we invited him to our house warming.

853
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,540
I think it was the first
time we'd ever met him.

854
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,240
And sort of, like we're
not very good at partying

855
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,670
and so by sort of 11 p.m.
or midnight or something

856
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,600
kind of everyone was going home and,

857
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,633
but Aaron was still there and

858
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,237
Aaron stayed until like 2 a.m.

859
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:49,640
I sort of remember kind of sitting in

860
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,990
our front room telling us how much better

861
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,010
it was to be building B2B software

862
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,067
then consumer software for this reason.

863
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:56,900
Remember I said consumer software,

864
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,940
it's so hard to predict
sort of what people want,

865
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,360
they don't even know
themselves what they want.

866
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,880
You're kind of, you're, it's
such an amorphous space.

867
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,910
Whereas when you're selling
software to businesses,

868
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,850
businesses are kind of,

869
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,730
are mostly rational, are mostly,

870
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,600
I don't know what the
opposite of inscrutable is,

871
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,710
scrutable I guess and you can sort

872
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,273
of work backwards in a way that sort of,

873
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,210
it's just much more comprehensible

874
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,150
and so I still have this kind of,

875
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,550
it's like the angel and
demon on your shoulder.

876
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,870
I still have sort of 2
a.m. Aaron Levie sitting

877
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,970
on my shoulder sort of
extolling the virtues

878
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,770
of building software for entities
that know what they want.

879
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,990
- You've made the right choice.

880
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,280
Yeah in some sense there's
a lot less variables

881
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,619
or consumer there's a lot more variables

882
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,231
to consider and they're quite unknown.

883
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,100
Let's take a step back.

884
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,436
You talked a little bit
about thinking about,

885
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:49,490
thinking ahead about why your team is

886
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,460
or what your company
structure is gonna look like,

887
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,240
how do you, maybe this
is too big of a question

888
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,660
so maybe we can whittle
it down a little bit

889
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,100
but how do you think about that?

890
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,280
Like I'm sitting, if I'm
starting a startup today,

891
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,380
I'm close to maybe product
market fit but before that stage.

892
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,050
Like am I thinking about
this sort of thing?

893
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,230
Like what should my team look like?

894
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,800
What should my culture
be and stuff like that?

895
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,870
- I think that well, okay.

896
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,933
So, pre-product market fit,

897
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,670
I mean the goal is, really is just

898
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,220
to guess your product market fit.

899
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,500
And so I actually wouldn't bother thinking

900
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,179
too much about all these kind

901
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,012
of distribution mechanics questions.

902
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:27,350
Now you can get product market fit sort of

903
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,530
relatively quickly and so kind
of that pre-product market

904
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,390
fit stage might only last six months.

905
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,860
You're not necessarily like Stripe

906
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,490
where you're kind of in
it for various reasons

907
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,870
for several multiple years.

908
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,530
And so it may not last very long.

909
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,060
However, until that point I really think

910
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,210
you should just be thinking about okay,

911
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,170
how do I get there?

912
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,710
The main thing that I
think companies screw up

913
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,850
at the pre-product market fit stage

914
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,810
is sort of speed of iteration.

915
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,310
I think okay well, what determines?

916
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,310
Or you kind of speed of fruitful
iteration in that sort of,

917
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,940
I mean if you're kind of completely,

918
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,680
or if you're repeatedly
re-building your product

919
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,300
but sort of not in
response to user feedback

920
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,770
I mean that's kind of far less likely

921
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,420
to be kind of bringing you
in sort of a I don't know,

922
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,350
in a productive direction.

923
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,750
But if you have some kind of meaningful,

924
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,030
I'll be it perhaps smalls
of initial set of users

925
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,320
and you're rapidly iterating a response

926
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,980
to sort of their feedback
and sort of observed behavior

927
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,520
and so on then I think that's like

928
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,190
a really good spot to be in.

929
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,720
And I think again at that juncture

930
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,970
of pre-product market
fit it is kind of this,

931
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,393
you should be sort of doing everything

932
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,743
you can to tighten that
sort of feedback cycle.

933
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,540
There's a fighter pilot in,

934
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,670
or who kind of revolutionized
air born combat

935
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,890
in the U.S. in sort of the second half

936
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,520
of the 20th century the
Korean War and onwards

937
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,765
called Boyd and he had this
concept of the OODA loop

938
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:47,210
which was sort of, a sort of
a similar notion of the most,

939
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,580
in a previous, you go far you want to just

940
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,350
like the fastest aircraft or sort

941
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,060
of the most sophisticated
weaponry and so on.

942
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,258
Where he was all about sort of,

943
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:56,441
no you actually wanted to air craft

944
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:57,870
and sort of pilots in training that

945
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,360
are really oriented around sort of

946
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,220
the fastest sort of
responsiveness in iteration

947
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,380
to the kind of particulars
of the situation.

948
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,100
In a way that kind of subsequently went

949
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,450
on to to really inform sort
of modern aircraft design.

950
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,370
And so I think you wanna be like,

951
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,760
one of these sort of modern fighters

952
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,260
where you're sort of
really optimized to sort

953
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,370
of respond as quickly as possible to sort

954
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,530
of rapidly evolving situations.

955
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,880
Again in this kind of
pre-product market stage.

956
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:23,586
And so from a hiring standpoint I think

957
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:24,690
it should really be about okay well,

958
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,210
what's gonna sort of,

959
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,630
what's gonna get you there faster?

960
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,970
And I mean I think at an early
stage it's most likely well,

961
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,310
sort of just people who will help you

962
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,760
kind of build a product.

963
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,569
But of course not too many because,

964
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,830
I mean at some point, like,

965
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,160
being able to do more,

966
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,610
but you might actually be less responsive

967
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,340
'cause you're bigger team to
manager or something right?

968
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,030
And so as an empirical matter,

969
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,594
it seems that somewhere in between kind of

970
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:48,950
two and 10 depending on
exactly what you're building

971
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,715
is kind of the optimally responsive size.

972
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,481
But I think it really is about that

973
00:36:55,481 --> 00:37:00,481
sort of time from observed
sort of necessity of deficiency

974
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,700
or this sort of characteristic
of your users behavior

975
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,210
to executed fix more improvement.

976
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,530
And for whatever it is that
kind of minimizes that.

977
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,530
- Is there, I mean you say two

978
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,493
to 10 which is helpful but is there,

979
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,670
are there observations
or evidence in which

980
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,630
you have hit the peak.

981
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,200
Like you should not add an extra,

982
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,883
like this extra person
- I see.

983
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:29,153
- is gonna be negative value
add to the whole operation.

984
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,170
- Yeah I mean every person,

985
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,780
every person, well,
startups in general involve

986
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,050
all these kind of impossibly difficult

987
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,001
sort of judgment calls and this kind of,

988
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:43,670
high dimensional possibilities phase

989
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,080
and so it'd be great if
you could sort of collapse

990
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,424
it down into a kind of a
friendly set of trade offs.

991
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:49,257
I just, I don't think you can.

992
00:37:49,257 --> 00:37:50,310
However I think in principle,

993
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,253
calculations you're trying to run is okay,

994
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,640
each successful person takes time to hire.

995
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,890
And so slows us down in that regard.

996
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,100
Takes time to onboard, slows
us down in that regard,

997
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,585
kinda takes times to I don't know just

998
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:02,691
kind of meld with the sort of culture

999
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:03,524
and learn the stack, all that stuff.

1000
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:04,890
That also takes cost and time.

1001
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,720
Then involves subsequent ongoing costs

1002
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,200
which is like coordination and alignment

1003
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,633
and sort of, you sort of now have,

1004
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:14,370
the organizations that distributed across

1005
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,670
more neurons and so there's
that kind of persistent tax.

1006
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,480
And that's not just
necessarily a linear cost

1007
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,550
but it can be sort of
quadratic or something

1008
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,331
kind of giving the multi
way communication problem.

1009
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:26,943
So you have all these costs
to an additional person

1010
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:27,790
and so the question is okay,

1011
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,010
but this person can also help us

1012
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,720
to like get more shit done right?

1013
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,580
They can write more code
or talk to more users

1014
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,320
or whatever and so it's kind of,

1015
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,040
is that fixed benefit to sort
of that additional person

1016
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,940
worth all these other costs and again

1017
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,640
I think with the ultimate R biter being,

1018
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,270
will we be more responsive to what

1019
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,620
we're learning about our users

1020
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,360
given the presence to
this additional person

1021
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,940
and I think whether or not you will be

1022
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,878
depends on the complexity of the product

1023
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:52,852
and the complexity of the
market and all that stuff.

1024
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,640
But I think that's in principle

1025
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,580
the calculation you ought to be running.

1026
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,737
- I've heard you say, and
speaking of hiring people,

1027
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,270
I've heard you say the key qualities

1028
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,960
that you look for in a future Stripe

1029
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
employee is intellectually honest,

1030
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,840
cares a great deal and just
loves getting things done.

1031
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,380
Which are great attributes because

1032
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,070
some people just don't
fit in those categories.

1033
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,660
So, it's good to have
the separation there.

1034
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,620
How do you, when you meet someone

1035
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,683
how do you figure out
this is the right person?

1036
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:24,810
(sighs)

1037
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,341
- It's very hard and I wish I had

1038
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:30,764
a more sort of definitive rubric.

1039
00:39:30,764 --> 00:39:33,260
And kind of particular set of questions.

1040
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,860
Although if I had a
particular set of questions,

1041
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,970
maybe they'd stop working because kind of,

1042
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,020
people would learn how to
game them or something.

1043
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,100
And so, I mean, well it's hard

1044
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,685
to fake just being smart right?

1045
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:52,363
And so that one's kind of
not as hard to discern.

1046
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:58,595
And I, it's oddly hard to fake
being intellectually honest.

1047
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:04,150
And sort of the characteristics of kind

1048
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,917
of being able to see multiple sides

1049
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,430
of a debate or an argument.

1050
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,500
Like there are so many kind
of complicated questions

1051
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,643
for sort of the only thing
that I'm really skeptical of

1052
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,750
is kind of certainty in either direction.

1053
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,920
Just 'cause the questions
are intrinsically sort of,

1054
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,620
involve very contingent trade offs.

1055
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,510
It's also, it's not
impossible but it's hard-ish

1056
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,344
to fake just being nice.

1057
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,760
Like something we hear
a lot about at Stripe

1058
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,690
is just sort of people
who are pleasant and warm

1059
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,120
and just sort of make others happier

1060
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,823
as a result of their presence.

1061
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,920
And if, well, perhaps if
you can fake that perfectly

1062
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,751
forever maybe that's fine right?

1063
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:50,277
(all laughing)

1064
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:51,110
- Pretty much.

1065
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,210
(audience laughs)

1066
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,070
- But yeah.

1067
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,445
They're all sort of actually,

1068
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:59,530
there's no clear rubric for them

1069
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,745
and I'm not sure
- Sure.

1070
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:01,810
- that a clear rubric could even work.

1071
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,643
- Yeah.

1072
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,180
So, you talk about, like
get people who help move

1073
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,578
the organization faster
if at all possible.

1074
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:13,490
And I think there are two issues

1075
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,840
usually that start slowing
down the organization

1076
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,740
as you start scaling just 'cause

1077
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,210
each person adds just more complexity

1078
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,910
to the organization but also,

1079
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,490
I think one is asymmetric information.

1080
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,000
Just people don't want, like
are never on the same page.

1081
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,867
And I think you've talked
a lot about this I think

1082
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,890
and so everyone can Google around

1083
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,870
for lectures you've given on this on,

1084
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,760
you've done email transparency,

1085
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,190
obviously having metrics transparent

1086
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,960
to the whole organization.

1087
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,440
But the second problem to that is,

1088
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,720
if you fix that there's also

1089
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,410
this asymmetric interpretation
problem which is,

1090
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,920
everyone's there's this
like black box function

1091
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,700
that how people interpretate,

1092
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,420
even if all the inputs are the same

1093
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,650
the outputs are all different and it's,

1094
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,850
especially at your skill
now it's nearly impossible

1095
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,790
to figure out everybody's function.

1096
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,170
So, when you're thinking about creating

1097
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,712
your organization and building it out,

1098
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:06,430
like how do you reduce that?

1099
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,823
Reduce that noise and try and
get everyone on the same page?

1100
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,573
- Yeah,

1101
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,210
well the first thing is
I wish we had actually,

1102
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,380
between say five and 50 people,

1103
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,100
I think we are much
too consensus oriented.

1104
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,870
We of course weren't
completely consensus oriented.

1105
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,960
I mean we couldn't have gotten
anything done if we were.

1106
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,075
But I think we kind of biased
too much in that direction.

1107
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,525
And again if I was doing all,

1108
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:36,349
it's just not that efficient, right?

1109
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:39,000
And sort of, it's
necessarily not the case.

1110
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,090
And so kind of,

1111
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,610
like you can sort of perhaps maintain

1112
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,320
some kind of fiction for more or less time

1113
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,000
but sort of ultimately speaking

1114
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,892
there is no way of sort
of sustaining that.

1115
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:54,090
And I think that's a relatively
common mistake right?

1116
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,796
Because you almost invariably
come from some kind

1117
00:42:56,796 --> 00:43:01,796
of end musketeers for
sort of small and sort of,

1118
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,230
kind of orientations where sort of,

1119
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,790
there's no particular need for sort

1120
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,790
of formal decision making mechanisms

1121
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,540
or sort of subsequent communication

1122
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,000
of said decisions or whatever right?

1123
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,187
But then you kind of, you hit 15 people

1124
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:17,570
and either is and I
think kind of companies

1125
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,550
don't adjust quickly enough
to sort of that new necessity.

1126
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,550
Again very much us included.

1127
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,080
And so I actually think
we did relatively well

1128
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,769
on the kind of ambient
availability of sort

1129
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:30,180
of context and information and so on.

1130
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,060
But actually kind of in some sense poorly

1131
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,000
at sort of deliberate explicit
communication of decisions.

1132
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,530
Decisions being I mean actual
kind of tactical decisions

1133
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,300
or even bigger decision like what are

1134
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,560
our priorities in the next six months

1135
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,963
or things of that nature.

1136
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,313
And so,

1137
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,660
the hybrid piece of advice

1138
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,380
and perhaps I'm over extrapolating

1139
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,450
from our personal experience,

1140
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,090
but the hybrid advice just kind

1141
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,710
of reflecting back would be to kind of,

1142
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,607
it's kind of like the pre and
post-product market fit thing.

1143
00:43:58,607 --> 00:43:59,790
But it's actually about the size

1144
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,513
of the organization where it kind of,

1145
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,367
if you hit a certain size and maybe,

1146
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:04,430
I'm just gonna say 10 people
for the sake of simplicity,

1147
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,366
maybe it's a bit before,

1148
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:07,374
maybe it's a bit after,

1149
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:08,857
I think you need to kind
of adjust more deliberately

1150
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,904
to this kind of explicit
communication model of sort of,

1151
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:15,330
of being sort of quite firmly

1152
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,494
non consensus based and sort of,

1153
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:22,230
I mean nobody likes the idea
of sort of being hierarchical.

1154
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,080
That sounds pejorative but
like in some sense hierarchal.

1155
00:44:26,517 --> 00:44:27,850
- Sort of the top down,

1156
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,770
like it does move things faster.

1157
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,727
Maybe some people don't like that

1158
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:33,150
but it does move faster.
- Yes.

1159
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,769
That's right, that's right and there

1160
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,416
is this kind of delicate
balancing act you wanna

1161
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:41,416
sort of orchestrate where
kind of on the one hand,

1162
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,540
you want to sort of
really prioritize speed

1163
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,400
and agility which involves being kind

1164
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,090
of somewhat hierarchical
because those are sort

1165
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,710
of efficient sort of
symmetry breaking mechanisms

1166
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,720
and ways to sort of to
have shots get called.

1167
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,780
But on the other hand you really do

1168
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,680
want people to have those kind

1169
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,130
of strong ownership
mentality and real sense

1170
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,796
that sort of they can
cause things to change

1171
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:10,180
or identify problems or
sort of inject new ideas

1172
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,800
even in unrelated areas.

1173
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,010
And so it's this sort of delicate act

1174
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,270
where I mean you definitely can

1175
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,670
be excessively hierarchical.

1176
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,170
But sort of how do you sort of facilitate

1177
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,900
enough autonomy and agency but also

1178
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,120
not have things devolve into this

1179
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,939
kind of I don't know sort of,

1180
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:29,570
uniform morass of sort of,

1181
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,830
I don't know all these kind of,

1182
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,050
of brownie and motion.

1183
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,840
And I think that's hard and requires

1184
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,210
all these kind of ongoing
sort of tweaks and nudges.

1185
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,440
And I mean it's dependent on
the personalities involved

1186
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,790
and all the rest and again I really wish

1187
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,990
there was the kind of
the sort of row simple.

1188
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,140
I'll just do X, Y and
Z and you'll be good.

1189
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,141
But sort of if such X
Y's and Z's exist I'm,

1190
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,130
no one's told me yet.

1191
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,010
- If only there was a formula
for everything (laughs).

1192
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,843
- If only.

1193
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,520
- So riding on the same theme,

1194
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,130
as Stripe grows, you
strike me as a company

1195
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,160
that does the opposite of most companies

1196
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,450
which as they get bigger
they just slow down

1197
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,040
and they get less
innovative but for you guys

1198
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,350
and it's hard to even keep up like,

1199
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,790
you're just pumping out new products

1200
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,570
and which seem to be successful to me

1201
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,797
like Stripe Atlas, Stripe Press,

1202
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:18,750
Stripe Terminal so on and so forth.

1203
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,210
So, in the early days, when
there's just nine or 10 of you

1204
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,400
if someone had a new idea
it's probably really easy

1205
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,990
to get to you and then
you guys would decide.

1206
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,350
How has that changed
over time to make sure

1207
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,840
that someone who's like
six degrees away from you,

1208
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,810
that a good idea actually gets to you?

1209
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,610
And then how is that decision made

1210
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,163
to actually execute upon it?

1211
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:44,788
- Well I'm, it's very nice to hear you say

1212
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:46,060
that you feel like we're getting faster

1213
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,593
as we get bigger because we're constantly

1214
00:46:48,593 --> 00:46:52,360
sort of self flagellating over
how like frickin' slow we are

1215
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,830
and like paranoid about
sort of, I don't know,

1216
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,090
degenerating into I don't know,

1217
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,003
some kind of I don't know
sort of immobile stupor.

1218
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:09,130
And so to whatever extent
we do get things done

1219
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,160
or appear fast I think
it's largely because we,

1220
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,410
we're very paranoid in this dimension

1221
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,800
and I think that kind
of the default outcome

1222
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,260
of companies or course as they scale

1223
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,510
is to become sort of more ossified

1224
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,523
and rigid and sort of,

1225
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:30,440
closed to new ideas and directions

1226
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,410
and things that contradict

1227
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,950
their prevailing
orthodoxies and all of that.

1228
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,777
As to how we kind of avoid that,

1229
00:47:38,777 --> 00:47:43,000
I mean well, there's lots
of kind of obvious things

1230
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,700
like partly it's sort of,

1231
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,420
I mean having leaders who care about

1232
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,650
the rate of progress and just love seeing

1233
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,718
things happen quickly and
lots of things of that nature,

1234
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:56,620
I think maybe sort od deeper rooted this,

1235
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,757
we try to be a kind of
yes and culture in that,

1236
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:05,500
I mean I personally love just ideas

1237
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,920
and potential things we could do

1238
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,570
and I mean most of them are,

1239
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,990
I mean no matter how good the idea is,

1240
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,240
sort of we should not
pursue most ideas right?

1241
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,350
Even if independently it could be

1242
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,530
a super successful company or something

1243
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,230
but like there is a fairly finite number

1244
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,150
of things we can do and so sort of,

1245
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,108
you kind of on the one hand need

1246
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,359
to recognize that intellectually

1247
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,192
and just like not pursue most things.

1248
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:27,070
On the other hand enjoying the exercise

1249
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,620
and contemplating well, what would it

1250
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,930
look like if we did it right?

1251
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,400
And so one thing we do
every year for example

1252
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,230
is we have this kind of crazy
ideas process we call it

1253
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,620
where we literally send a
document to the whole company,

1254
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,330
a hack pod document
that's open to everyone

1255
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:44,190
and people can sort of add ideas to it,

1256
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,660
they think are probably a bad idea

1257
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,173
but if they worked might be a great idea.

1258
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,270
And it's very important that they

1259
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,840
have to be probably a bad idea

1260
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,210
because if they're like
probably a good idea

1261
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,760
then I mean it's not that risky

1262
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,730
and I mean kind of by definition we

1263
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,686
should probably do it and so whatever.

1264
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,550
Maybe we should just do it.

1265
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,700
And so, people like really self sensor

1266
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,780
a lot in most organizations because

1267
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,920
they don't want to look stupid and

1268
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,330
they don't want to be sort of associated

1269
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,910
with just having all
these like wacky bad ideas

1270
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,560
and so on and so we try to be fairly firm

1271
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,720
that if you add ideas to this

1272
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,370
it has to be probably a bad idea.

1273
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
And actually a lot of cool things

1274
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,360
we've subsequently gone on and done

1275
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,240
first came from that process.

1276
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,723
Stripe App was being one of them.

1277
00:49:29,722 --> 00:49:34,710
And also we sort of helped
Stellar get off the ground,

1278
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,597
this sort of cryptic
currency back a few years ago

1279
00:49:36,597 --> 00:49:40,110
and sort of that also sort
of came from this process.

1280
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,990
And so that's one of the mechanisms

1281
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,414
by which we try to have that
kind of yes and culture.

1282
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:50,414
And I really think there aren't that many,

1283
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,050
as just as an empirical matter,

1284
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,100
there aren't that many large organizations

1285
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,863
that I think sort of really
do this successfully.

1286
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,000
But I think that sort of the

1287
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,430
most successful larger organizations

1288
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,503
somehow do succeed in
sort of this iterative

1289
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:13,670
repeated process of kind of augmentation.

1290
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,289
Amazon and Google being kind
of the most prominent examples.

1291
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:18,610
Where obviously when Google launched

1292
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,790
there was no Gmail or YouTube or Android

1293
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,680
or Google Maps or whatever.

1294
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,270
And Amazon sort of is kind of

1295
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,623
an even more conspicuous
example in some sense

1296
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,270
of this kind of repeated attach

1297
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,770
at successful ancillary businesses.

1298
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,121
And so I think kind of,

1299
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:35,390
yeah it's a very natural
temptation as you grow

1300
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,480
to I think becoming
increasingly close to this.

1301
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,830
I think it's very important to avoid.

1302
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,663
- Cool.

1303
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,526
So I have a couple more questions

1304
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:43,490
and then maybe we'll have time

1305
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,760
to take questions from the audience.

1306
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,510
One is, looking back, is there something,

1307
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,126
did you have a strong opinion of

1308
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:52,290
how startups should be run as a CEO

1309
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,230
that have just completely reversed

1310
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,858
because you're now the CEO?

1311
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:02,441
(audience member coughing)

1312
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,503
- That's a good question.

1313
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:10,651
- Another way to potentially put it

1314
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,430
is like what are things that you did

1315
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,416
where you're like I know for
sure this should've been done

1316
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,887
and then it just turned out
to be a mistake (laughs)?

1317
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:20,948
- Right.

1318
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,210
Well I already mentioned the sort of,

1319
00:51:28,597 --> 00:51:29,533
the consensus orientation.

1320
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:32,244
One that we're going through right now

1321
00:51:32,244 --> 00:51:35,100
which is a quite sort of
significant divergence

1322
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,207
is we were sort of fairly centralized

1323
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,850
up until sort of relatively recently.

1324
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,440
I mean we had some remote employees

1325
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,630
from a pretty early stage
but by and large Stripe

1326
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,630
was kinda concentrated in San Francisco.

1327
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:52,156
Last week we announced
our fourth global hub

1328
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:53,810
and basically what we've decided to do

1329
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,680
is we're gonna have kind of major sort

1330
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,270
of project and engineering sort of efforts

1331
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:02,850
and teams and functions and
all the rest in San Francisco,

1332
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:07,623
also in Seattle, also in
Dublin and also in Singapore.

1333
00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:11,690
And so these non San Francisco locations

1334
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,560
are not gonna be sort of I don't know,

1335
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,080
operations offices or satellite offices

1336
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,560
or places where we do some kind

1337
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,060
of localization and
local market adaptation.

1338
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,940
We want to have kind of
completely de novo new products

1339
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,370
that sort of become super successful

1340
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,720
started out of these offices.

1341
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,810
And that's not the sort
of centered obviously

1342
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,090
kind of Silicon Valley pattern

1343
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,210
versus Apple and Amazon and Facebook

1344
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,820
and Google and all these companies tend

1345
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,900
to be sort of highly concentrated in these

1346
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,893
sort of very sort of monolithic
corporate headquarters.

1347
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:45,570
And our thesis is that
it's kind of several folds.

1348
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,460
Partly that kind of the
availability of talent

1349
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,430
is becoming sort of far more
geographically dispersed.

1350
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,490
Partly that sort of the Bay
area's becoming increasing

1351
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,800
untenable expensive location to locate.

1352
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,040
And partly that sort of,
we really want Stripe

1353
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,430
to be global infrastructure that works

1354
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,980
kind of just as well in
sort of Asian markets

1355
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,680
or in Latin American markets or whatever

1356
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,730
as it does for businesses in the U.S.

1357
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,610
and kind of the era of the internet being

1358
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,200
a predominately North American

1359
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,910
or North American Western
European or whatever,

1360
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:15,730
the days of being kind of
such a phenomenon are over.

1361
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,180
And so, I think that's sort
of a fairly substantial break

1362
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,180
with kind of descriptive
best practice of the past.

1363
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,611
I mean we obviously think it'll work.

1364
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:28,006
I mean we wouldn't do it if we didn't

1365
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:30,650
but it is also kind of
on some level risky.

1366
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,368
Like we don't have good
prior examples to point to

1367
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:36,120
and I mean there's some great companies

1368
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,190
in Singapore like Grab and Carousel.

1369
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,670
There aren't really
sort of any examples yet

1370
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,330
of sort of American companies establishing

1371
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,260
kind of major private
engineering hubs there.

1372
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,884
We're pretty optimistic it can be done

1373
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:50,884
but if it works we'll be the
first or one of the first.

1374
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,840
- Cool.

1375
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,673
Last question.

1376
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:59,437
So in 100 years from now
what is Stripe gonna be?

1377
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:00,470
What do you imagine it to be?

1378
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,788
- Well we're only seven
years old so that's a,

1379
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:03,908
(audience laughs)

1380
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,740
a full question to answer.

1381
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,400
I mean we're trying to build this kind of,

1382
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,830
this economic infrastructure
for the internet

1383
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,580
and this sort of platform
for globalization

1384
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,580
and kind of I don't know,
sort of technological progress

1385
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,810
in the sense that like it
ought to be just as easy

1386
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:27,700
to start a company in sort of Nigeria

1387
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,290
as it is New York and it should be

1388
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,610
just as easy for somebody in Brazil

1389
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,600
to buy something sort of from any

1390
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,520
of these companies as it is for again

1391
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,520
somebody in the Western world.

1392
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,113
And,

1393
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,690
it just just seemed so crazy to me

1394
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,960
that sort of that hasn't happened yet.

1395
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,350
Like I, it sort of feels Stripe

1396
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,540
should've happened 10 or 20 years

1397
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,686
before it did and kind of,

1398
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:55,350
I don't so much think that we're sort of

1399
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,090
pursuing this sort of unprecedented

1400
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,903
kind of path breaking or,

1401
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,230
sort of inconceivable idea so much

1402
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,063
as kind of correcting a deficiency

1403
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:12,063
in sort of a rip in the fabric
of internet infrastructure.

1404
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:15,643
And so anyway I think we still have

1405
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:18,540
at least five years to go in sort

1406
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,393
of correcting this inadequacy.

1407
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:24,950
As to what happens
after that I'm not sure.

1408
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,365
- Got it.

1409
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,760
In some sense in the
future all transactions

1410
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,810
should be digital and they could very well

1411
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,280
just all be going through Stripe.

1412
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,860
I mean right now like, in the U.S. someone

1413
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,870
was telling me like 80% of all Americans

1414
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,560
have done some transaction
through Stripe right?

1415
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,670
- Yeah that's right.

1416
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,164
So in the last 12 months, more
than 80% of American adults

1417
00:55:46,164 --> 00:55:49,490
have bought something
from a Stripe business.

1418
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,640
At least one thing from a Stripe business.

1419
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,210
Which is cool and it's not
just the case in the U.S.

1420
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,300
Like in Singapore where I was last week,

1421
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,623
that figure is about 70% right?

1422
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,040
But I guess we don't think about,

1423
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,981
well I think about it more in terms of

1424
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:06,530
the things that are possible

1425
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,702
or get started as in it's kind of,

1426
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:13,060
we think a lot about the rate
of sort of new firm creation.

1427
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,620
What companies are getting started,

1428
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,080
how successful are those companies?

1429
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,900
Which markets can they serve and so on

1430
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,050
and every now and again we look back

1431
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,670
and we look at sort of those
kinds of market coverage stats.

1432
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,690
But I guess that's not
really what sort of,

1433
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,060
what motivates it.

1434
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,020
It's more that sort of
there are these businesses

1435
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,065
that should exist and or should

1436
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:33,463
be able to offer their
products and services

1437
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,628
in these place where they currently can't

1438
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:38,889
and that's I think, I
mean, that's the kind

1439
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:40,590
of thinking that we use to kind

1440
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,200
of inform the product and that sort of

1441
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,960
is kind of the core I don't know,

1442
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,930
locomotion day to day and then maybe

1443
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,220
the outcome of that is that I don't know,

1444
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,240
all these people get to that info from it.

1445
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,073
- Alright.

1446
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:53,032
Thank you so much Patrick.

1447
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:53,865
- Cool, thank you.
- This was great.

1448
00:56:53,865 --> 00:56:57,115
