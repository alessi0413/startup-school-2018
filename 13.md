Geoff Ralston: Alright. Good morning everyone.
Audience: Good morning.
Geoff Ralston: We are halfway through Startup School. Can you believe it? Already. Wow. Yeah. Or more  correctly, we will be after this week\.
And this is going to be a great  week of talks, lectures conversations. Today, we have Tyler from Clever, who's going to give  a talk on how to sell, to begin with\.
And afterwards Harj and Ammon from  Triplebyte are going to talk about how to build an engineering organization. Two pretty important  things if you want to build a successful company\.
I will start off quickly with  my usual administrivia. We will shortly be sending out a midpoint feedback form for you  guys to fill out. We really would appreciate getting as many responses as possible. This  is our form of talking to our customers, you all, and getting feedback. We're always  trying to improve Startup School, we hope to do it every year and make it  better every year. So please tell us what you think and what you think we  should change\.
Adora and I were talking a little bit about updates\.
And I've talked  to a bunch of people live, and some on the forum about updates and what  makes sense for updates\.
And just to put it bluntly, think hard about your metrics,  the ones you're using. Do not use bullshit metrics. What is a bullshit metric? It's  a metric that doesn't really measure the road to success for you\.
It's something you're  making up\.
Any startup that you're building is an enormous, complicated, difficult, crazy task\.
And  no matter what you're doing, if there is no milestone on the way to achieving  that enormous task, then you're kidding yourself and it's not really a step on the  way to success. Those milestones are more than anything for you. For you to measure  that you're making progress towards your goal. So don't make stuff up because you think  that's what we want to hear. Or just because you're bored, they won't help you.  Okay\.
As always problems et cetera, email to startupschool@ycombinator.com\.
And with that, I think, Tyler,  we are ready to go. So, my good friend Tyler Bosmeny, from Clever.
Tyler Bosmeny: Hey everyone\.
It's an honor to be here, speaking with you today. Thanks for having  me. My name is Tyler Bosmeny\.
I'm the CEO of a company called Clever\.
And  I wanted to talk to you about something that I think is one of the  most fundamental and important things any founder needs to master, which is sales\.
And before  I get started and share some of the things I've learned and picked up over  the way, I thought it might be helpful to share my own personal journey to  sales as something that I've come to learn and just really appreciate and respect as  a craft. When I was in school, when I was in college, I was a  math major. My graduate degree was in statistics\. 
I was the last person I ever  thought would ever do sales\.
And so my own journey to getting here was I  was working on the college newspaper, I joined the college newspaper, it seemed like a  fun thing to do\.
I had some friends who were on it\.
And one of  the roles they had open was they needed somebody to run the advertising for the  newspaper\.
And so I was spending in college hours a day, figuring out how to  sell ads to local businesses, so we'd have enough money to print and put out  the paper every day\.
And doing this for several years, if you know anything about  college newspapers, you know one of the things, the biggest determinant of how much money  they make every year is how well the economy is doing, because lot of the  ads are for recruiters. But I just happened to be there during some very good  years\.
And when I was leaving the advertising sales team, we set records for The  Crimson and so we sold a lot of ads\.
And so I thought, "Okay, this  is interesting, it's an interesting craft." And then as I was getting ready to graduate  school, getting ready to graduate go off to college, excuse me, go to work\.
I'm  doing math, I'm thinking, you go off to finance, do a hedge fund something like  that\.
A buddy starting a company and he says to me, "Tyler, I need you  to come join because you're the only person I know who knows how to do  sales." And let me tell you I was offended. This was not how I saw  myself. This was not you know what I imagined doing after school, but I was  also really intrigued\.
And I was really good friends with this guy\.
And I said,  "Why the heck not?" So I ended up going on a very different path and  joining his startup building a sales team, we were selling to newspapers across the country.  And if you've ever worked with or thought about newspapers before, you can imagine they  are very hard customers to sell to\.
And so I really cut my teeth and  have a lot of fun, frankly, over many years figuring out how to sell into  this market\.
And we sold to a lot of newspapers. Then fast forward a little  bit and I come on to start Clever and one of the co-founders started through  Y Combinator about six years ago\.
And if you don't know anything about Clever, we're  a single sign on platform used in schools, and today, over half the schools in  America use Clever and so we've really done a lot of selling and really had  to figure this out once again in a different context\.
And so, I was thinking  about, what would be most helpful to talk about, what I'd most want to hear  in your shoes, or what I most would have appreciated knowing when I was first  starting to cut my teeth on sales\.
And so that's what I want to share  with you today\.
It's just things I've picked up along the way. Some observations I've  had, and hopefully some practical tips that you can take home and implement, as you  get your startups off the ground running sales. Sales has a lot of mystique and  a lot of lore around it. Or at least it did to me when I  was thinking about sales early in my career. When we think about sales and we  think about sales people, a lot of us picture Don Draper, we picture these people  who are so charming, so impossibly funny, who they always have the right line at  the right moment to win the deal, they're of course, incredible golfers This is how  sales is portrayed in every movie, in every TV show\.
And so a lot of  people go through life thinking that this is what sales is about\.
And because we  build up this mystique of what sales is, and the types of people who can  do sales, I hear founders say very often things like, "Well, right now we're just  building the product\.
And once it's finished, then we'll go and hire the sales people."  Well, guess what? Hire the sales people. That's you\.
And that looks nothing like the  mystique and it looks nothing like the lore in my experience. This is my co  founder, Dan and the early days of Clever when we were doing sales. Here he  is on a broken chair, in a three by three call room\.
I think he's  eating a bagel, because he probably didn't have time for breakfast. That's what sales looks  like, could not be further from the Don Draper imagery that a lot of people  think of. So sales is you\.
And Y Combinator, I remember when we were going  through the program, Paul Graham got up on the stage, and he said, "You should  be spending every moment of every day doing one of two things, building a product,  or talking to users." And talking to users, a big part of that can be  selling. So this is a core responsibility of every startup founder, is not just building  the product, but also talking to your users understanding their needs\.
And as you learn  that is really a big part of what selling is. So this is a core  responsibility for founders\.
A lot of founders think, "Well, I haven't done sales before." And  that's true\.
And they say, "Well, I'm not good at sales yet." And that could  be true too. But one thing I've learned, is that as founders you also have  some very unique advantages that can make you actually incredibly powerful at sales and very  potent\.
And the two advantages that I've noticed, one, is just your passion. You are  more passionate about the product that you're building and selling than anyone in the world.  Because otherwise, you probably wouldn't have irrationally quit your jobs and moved in with your  parents, or whatever you've done to start this company. So one is your passion. That  is so powerful in sales\.
And the second thing you have is industry expertise. You  know this problem better than anyone, you know why it needs to exist, you understand  this problem more deeply, hopefully, than anyone\.
And so these two things, even if you've  never done sales before, mean you can be incredibly effective\.
And so don't think otherwise.  Early on with Clever, one of the things we did that really worked for us  was I had two co-founders. So there were three of us, and we just decided  that one of us had to own sales\.
It was so important that we needed  one person to be thinking about this every day\.
And so that ended up becoming  me. My other two co-founders were focused on building the product and implementing the product  and we decided this was important enough that I decided I was going to peel  off and spend almost 100% of my time selling this product, starting from before it  was even built. So from that point, from early enough on, think about who in  your company is really owning this and it should probably be a founder and it  should probably be as much of a full time job as you can spare. So  now I want to talk about how sales actually works, and if you know anything  about sales, Sales 101 is a lot of people talk about it like a funnel  and there's different variations of this funnel\.
I have a really simple one that I  put up here step one of the funnel is finding prospects, prospecting, these are leads  who might even be interested in buying your product, who might even be interested in  taking a call. From there you have conversations. Okay, so you figured out they're interested  but you got to have a lot of conversations to figure out, "Is this the  right product for them or not?" Third is closing. Okay, they actually want to buy  the product. How do you not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and lose  the deal, you have to go through a closing process\.
And if you complete all  of those things, then hopefully you're in the promised land\.
And you have revenue, and  you have your first sales\.
And so this is how I think about the funnel.  And what I'm going to do now is just walk you through each of these  stages and share how I've approached these in my career and some tips that have  worked for me along the way. So your mission in the first stage of prospecting  is to figure out who will even take your call\.
And one of the things  that for me was really helpful to understand is well, you're going to hear no  a lot, you start talking about a new product to people and you're just going  to hear a lot of nos. But one of the things that was really helpful  for me to understand is you have this technology adoption curve. This was put out  by a guy, Everett Rogers and the 60s\.
And it starts on the left, you  have your innovators, and you have your early adopters of new technology, your early majority,  your late majority, your laggards. These are terms that people in Silicon Valley throw around,  that I've been hearing for years. But what I didn't know was that the inventor  of this framework, this technology adoption lifecycle, Everett Rogers, he described it as a bell  curve\.
And he actually went through the effort of quantifying the area under the curve  in each of these different segments\.
And one of the things you notice is looking  at this, the innovators segment is just 2.5% of the population. That means 2.5% of  companies will even consider buying a product from a startup that is unproven, with no  revenue\.
And when you realize that to some founders, that's kind of depressing, wow, that's  a very small percent of the market. But when I found this out, I actually  found it massively motivating and massively invigorating. Because all of a sudden, it makes what  you have to do really clear, you have to talk to a lot of people  because you have to find that to 2.5%\.
It's a numbers game, means you're going  to have to reach out to at least 100 companies to find just two and  a half on average, who are even potential buyers for your product. You're basically playing  a version of, Where's Waldo, where you are looking for the very few companies who  might be in this innovator segment\.
And so expect early on sales is not reaching  out for 10 companies, reaching out and doing sales is a lot of grinding and  it's a lot of effort in order to get the result you want. When it  comes to actually starting these conversations, I found there's three things that worked for me.  So in terms of finding those innovators, the first thing that has worked well for  me is using my network. The second, which is a little surprising to people is  conferences, and I'm going to talk about that\.
And the third is cold emails. These  are the three ways in which I find prospects\.
I'm not going to talk about  my networks\.
I think most people understand that. But I can tell you many of  the earliest deals I've done at every company I've been at, have been through people  I've known, friends of friends. So do not underestimate your network, especially if you know  the industry. You might think it's not very big, but you probably know a few  people and those people might know a few people and so spend some time thinking  about your network because you might find some really great sales opportunities that come through  there, and those are the best. You don't need 100 people in your network to  get to sales, you can usually deal with much fewer. But let's talk about conferences  because I think conferences are the most underrated aspect of sales and one of the  least understood aspects of sales. When I say conferences, a lot of people think I'm  talking about this, CES or E3 and going to some place where there's 80,000 people,  and it's basically more like a rock concert than anything else\.
And when I say  conferences, I'm talking about something very different. Usually they look like this. Usually it's a  bunch of executives or people in a hotel room, cooped up for a couple days,  oftentimes, you know, in places like Milwaukee or Kansas\.
And let me tell you, this  is such a powerful way, these conferences are such a powerful way to meet your  users. You have to go where users are\.
And many times if you're selling to  a business or to a corporate buyer, this is where users are, they go to  conferences, they're there with their peers, they're learning\.
And that's where you should be to.  Now, let me say a few words about how I've approached conferences in the past.  Because this really is where so many of Clever's initial partnerships and customers came from.  One, figure out what are the big industry conferences for your product and your startup.  Usually, there's not just one, usually there's like 10, and you have to work to  figure out what they are\.
Ask people in the industry, "What conferences do you go  to? Which ones are on your radar?" But there's usually quite a few and definitely  more than one. Two, pick a few that you're going to attend, buy a ticket,  sometimes they're expensive, thousands of dollars, sometimes you don't even need a ticket, it depends  on the event. But figure out the conference and decide you're going to go hopefully  weeks or months in advance. Three, get the list. This is such an important part  of making conferences like this worthwhile. Find a way to know who's going to be  there, write to the organizers, write to sponsors, maybe it's on the website. But figure  out who's going to be there in advance. Don't just show up at a conference  and think you're going to network your way and meet everybody\.
Although if you can  pull that off, by all means, do it\.
It's just not something that everyone can  do. But when you have the list of who's going to be there, then you  can email people in advance, and say, "Hey, I'm going to be at this event,  I noticed you are too, I'm working on this thing\.
I'd love to show it  to you. Can we find some time to chat?" And don't just do it with  a few people, do it with as many potential buyers or prospects as you can.  My goal when I go to a conference or when anyone from Clever goes to  a conference is that we have our entire days booked up in 30 minute increments.  Because we've done so much effort in advance of the conferences, trying to line everything  up getting these meetings and they end up becoming the most productive day of the  year when we actually go, and we actually get to have all of these conversations  and have all of these buyers and I get to the end of a night,  even the first night at a conference, when I yeah, just been doing one day  ..\.
And let me tell you every time I am exhausted, and I am also  so energized because there's nothing that's more fun than meeting with customers and meeting with  potential buyers and hearing their reactions to what you're building. So I cannot emphasize enough  how important conferences have been in every company I've worked in sales at, and I  highly recommend you explore this. So that's conferences. The other and frankly the probably more  common approach is cold emails. People don't really cold call too much anymore. Maybe you  can make it work, but cold emails I mean, I still do that today\.
And  a lot of people don't know how to write cold emails, they don't know how  to reach out to someone in a productive way\.
I know this because I'm on  the receiving end of so many bad cold emails, we probably all are. They're really  long, they're not personalized, they're not actionable, they're boring, they're irrelevant. So don't do that.  But if you don't do that, well, then what do you do? How do you  have a cold email strategy that's effective? In the early days of Clever, in the  early days of other startups, we would sit down and we'd send, 10, 30, 50  emails to cold prospects\.
And it would look something like this\.
And I actually found  an old email and I put it up here so you guys can see it,  you feel free to copy it, but it is the simplest thing in the world.  You'll notice it's short\.
It's to the point it's personalized\.
It's actionable, "Hey, my name  is Tyler\.
And I'm the CEO of Clever this is what we do\.
I thought  this might be relevant for you because of XYZ reason that's personal to you. Even  if you're not in the market, I'd love to chat with you about this, which  is true. Do you have some time this week or later this week? I'm free  I'm free now or I'm free at this time." Super simple, this will probably get  read as opposed to some of the paragraph long diatribes about why my product is  the best and why you're crazy for not using it and before we even met.  All you're trying to do is get a call with somebody and actually meet them.  And so we'll send out cold emails\.
It's very effective, but make sure you do  it right. Make sure you're writing emails that are interesting to people, that aren't too  salesy, that are personalized and that are genuine\.
And remember, all you're trying to do  is get a conversation, get out of that prospecting phase and into stage two, which  is conversations. So let's talk about stage to stage two. Okay, you've gone to conferences,  you've done cold emails, you've worked your network and now you're talking to prospects. This  is exciting. People want to talk to you. They might want to buy your product.  This is what you've been waiting for. When this happens, and you get them on  the phone, remember to shut up and listen\.
And when people ask me, "What's your  number one sales tip?" When new sales people say, "What's the number one thing I  should practice or work on?" If you take nothing else from this presentation, take this.  Sales is about listening\.
I've had the opportunity in my life to shadow some of  who I think are some of the best sales people in the world, incredibly successful  salespeople\.
And they look nothing like the picture I showed you on the first slide.  They were soft spoken and what I remember specifically was that they were world class  listeners\.
And the reason that's so important is because that's what sales is at its  core. People think sales is about just being a battering ram and just hitting or  getting your points across, and repeating them over and over until somebody finally breaks down  and buys your product\.
And let me tell you, that doesn't work\.
And what does  work is building relationships with people understanding their problems, understanding what their needs are, and  then seeing if you can help them with your solution\.
And in order to make  that happen, you have to listen. So most founders when I ..\.
I've shattered a  lot of sales calls and one thing I see very frequently as a founder, they're  so excited. They finally got someone on the phone, they're hooked. They're definitely going to  be the first customer and they get them on the phone and they just talk.  And it's understandable, right? You're excited, you're excited about your product, you're passionate about it,  you can't wait to show off every bell and whistle that you've spent months thoughtfully  building. But it will totally kill your sales deal. What you'll naturally do is talk  for 70% of the time on the first call, and maybe leave 30% of space  for the other person. The best sales people in the world, when I've seen them  in action, it's the opposite. They're listening 70% of the time\.
And they're asking questions  like, "Hey, tell me about the problem you're having. How do you solve it today?  Why did you even agree to take my call? What would your ideal solution look  like if you could have anything?" They're asking questions because they care, and they want  to understand and they want to figure out how to help this person solve their  problem, and yes, their product might be part of that solution, but it involves deep  listening. One trick I can share on this, is at Clever we use a tool  called UberConference\.
And UberConference is great. But one of the things I love about it,  is that the end of each call, it sends you an email, and it tells  you how much time you spent talking versus how much time the other person spent  talking\.
And it's funny because I can look at these and it's a running joke.  I'll look at these and sometimes you'll talk to someone and say, "I just got  off a call\.
It was great\.
I nailed it, they're going to definitely buy." And  then I'll look at the UberConference call email at the end. Then if it looks  like that, I'll say, "I don't think that call went as well as you think."  I don't know if we're really ready to make that sale quite yet\.
And so  the number one thing that I hope to impress on you today is sales is  about listening\.
And it's not just about a hacker asking the right questions, it's about  genuinely listening\.
And if you can do that, the rest is easy\.
It really is.  So you've spent all this time prospecting, now you've had your phone calls, you've done  a good job listening\.
And then another thing to know about sales, is there's a  lot of steps to the process. Up here, I have a lot of different steps  that you might go through in a sales process, calls, emails, pricing calls, sending references,  talking with different executives, there are a lot of steps to sales\.
And up here,  these aren't just hypothetical steps. What I've put up here are actually all of the  steps from one of my very first deals at Clever. This is one deal, and  frankly some of the stuff is kind of embarrassing, right? Like met the person, they  were interested, I emailed, no response\.
I emailed them again, no response\.
I emailed them  again, they responded. Scheduled a call, email, no response\.
I mean, this is straight up  embarrassing\.
And this is from someone who wanted to buy our product\.
Isn't that crazy?  So one of the things I hope to impress on you is, it is a  lot of work to do sales well, and it takes a lot of follow up,  and you kind of have to have this inhumane willingness to just keep going and  push through. This whole lifecycle probably took about two months, it ended up. We ended  up closing $100,000 a year customer, but this is what it took\.
And I talked  to a lot of founders who maybe they have a good meeting, they do a  follow up email, and they don't get a response\.
And they're like, "Oh, well, maybe  they weren't interested after all. Maybe it's not a good fit." And they disqualify themselves.  Well, just remember, this is what a success case looks like, at least if you're  doing enterprise sales\.
And it's not over till it's over\.
And it's not over till  they say no. But sometimes you do have to remind them, "Hey, I'm still here.  Hey, are you still interested?" Because probably your buyers have a lot on their mind,  that's not you or your startup\.
And probably they have a lot of other things  going on in their life\.
And so being persistent isn't rude, being persistent can be  helpful, if you do it in the right way, and you're respectful. Now, I will  say one thing here. Follow up is really good and really important. But what's also  really good, sometimes you get a no\.
And getting those nos can also be really  good and really helpful. Because when you're a small start up founder, small founding team,  you've got to figure out where to spend your time and energy and you can't  have a pipeline of hundreds and hundreds of deals going at one time. You just  can't, you won't be able to do it\.
And so there's actually a lot of  value. My friend Steve Garrity taught me this. There's a lot of value to driving  conversations to a yes or no quickly. Because nos, you can move on and start  filling the pipeline with other people that could become yeses. So I would encourage you  to have relentless follow up, be determined. Don't let things drop but at the same  time if you get a no, see it as a blessing in disguise because you  can move on to the next deal that could be a yes. Okay, so you've  prospected, you've had these great conversations with customers, you've made it through the rigmarole, you've  gone through all these steps. Now let's talk about closing. This is an area that  is weird, it's foreign. So you have to figure out how to close a contract  with a customer who's told you they want to buy, it's harder than it sounds.  A lot of deals get messed up in here. So let me just walk you  through a few things I've learned. One, assuming you're doing an enterprise contract, you'll need  an agreement, and then you'll send it over to the company, and they want to  change the agreement\.
It's a process called redlining\.
And then their lawyers will send it  back to you, and you might look at it or your lawyers might look at  it, you might have more changes and you go back and forth in this redlining  process. So the first step is you need to have an agreement to propose\.
And  by the way, they're going to expect it from you. When they're interested, they're going  to say, "Send me an agreement." And make sure that you have something or you've  been working on something so that it's not like, "Oh, I'll get back to you  in a month." If you don't have something, I've good news which is if you're  not aware, YC has an open source sales template, posted on their website, and I  worked on this with James Reilly at Goodwin Procter and some other folks including the  Y Combinator legal team and YC decided to open source this. So any of you  can use it. Obviously you'll probably need to customize it for your needs, and at  some point, you'll want to get counsel, but as a basic starting point, there is  a free template that you can use for sales in Y Combinator's website\.
And then  once you're going into this back and forth, I'll never forget it\.
I have seen  some founders let this process drag out for months fighting over the dumbest things. When  you are at an early stage startup, when you are trying to get your first  customers, early customers are like manna from heaven\.
And if you don't get them, you're  not going to go very far, you're done\.
And yet, I have seen startups in  the early phase because they think that what they're supposed to do or someone gave  them bad advice, quibble over the dumbest things. So my advice for you is when  you get to this step, especially for your first early customers, they're gonna want to  put weird things in the contract with indemnity clauses and warranty clauses and get it  reviewed by a lawyer, don't sign anything dumb. But your goal is to finish and  move on and just keep that in mind\.
And if you're going through four or  five, six revision processes, you're doing something wrong. So figure out how to move this  quickly and don't quibble over small things. Get the first customers because that's what you  need to keep going. Okay, another closing trap. You got the customer interested, they want  to buy, things look great\.
And they come to you and they say, "Hey, actually,  I want to buy but only if you had this one other feature, would I  buy." It sounds so promising. You're so close. They just want one more thing, so  you can build that thing\.
It wouldn't be that hard. Unfortunately, once you start hearing  this, in my experience, unfortunately, it is more often a pass than anything else\.
And  the thing to remember is unfortunately, building that one thing when someone says, "Oh, I  would buy it, except it's just missing that one thing." If you built it, there'd  probably be another thing after that, and another thing after that\.
And you don't want  to be in a world where you're building lots of one off things for customers.  Now your first customer, second customer, do what it takes folks. But very quickly, you  get in a world where you start hearing this and you realize it's not a  good thing\.
And so two ways I've seen of solving this, one is, well, if  you really want the sale and you really want to hold them to their word  and have that commitment, say, "Okay, well, I'll build it if you agree to buy  the product." Which means I can't demo it for you today, I can't show you  reference customers on this thing you want, but I will build it for you if  you sign up and if you've spent the time listening and building the relationship and  they trust you, that can work.The other thing is you say, "Look, we're going to  build what customers need, and we're going to wait till we hear from more customers."  And oftentimes I find even in that case, if they still want the product they'll  buy it even without that one feature and hopefully end up building what they need  anyways. But at least then you're not building something for just one customer. Third closing  trap, free trials, you get so close to someone, they're so interested, they're your perfect  first customer\.
And then they say, "Yeah, we just like to try it for 60  days. Folks when you are starting your company and when you are out there trying  to make your startup work, you need things like commitment, you need validation, you need  revenue, and guess what? A free trial doesn't get you any of those things\.
And  so at every company I've been at, I've never worked at a company where they  did free trials. We just said we can't do it. We're spending a lot of  time out here trying to find the right customers for our product, just spending a  lot of time building the right product, we're not going to give it away for  free on the hopes that maybe you'll decide you want it. But we flipped it  around and said, "But we want to be reasonable\.
And we know you're taking a  chance on us, there's risk. So we only do annual agreements here. That's how we  operate. But if for any reason you're not satisfied, in the first 30 days, you  can opt out of the agreement, and there won't be any penalty, you can cancel."  And having it that way, where the default is they're a customer, but if something  goes wrong, they're still protected, actually it's kind of both parties meeting in the middle  and it solves for their concern that they're taking a risk on someone new, while  solving for your concern, which is that you need commitment and validation to keep going.  And way better to be in a case where they default is that they're a  customer than the default is, well, you need to renegotiate something in 60 days from  now and you're right back where you started. So to the extent you can avoid  the free trial trap. So that's closing. So now you know how I've approached prospecting,  how I approached the conversations, how I've approached closing, happy to answer questions on these  when we break, but just end on some final parting thoughts. What I've described here  is the enterprise sales process I've used going from zero to 1,000,000. First million in  revenue, this is the exact process we've used multiple times and it's worked. But not  every company, every company is different\.
And one of the things that I love to  encourage founders to think about early is what kind of company and specifically what kind  of sales motion are you going to have in the long term? Kristof [Jents] who's  a VC, has this really incredible blog post\.
I just love how memorable it is.  But he says, "There's five ways to build 100 million dollar business from a sales  perspective\.
If your average customer pays you $100,000, well then you just need to find  1000 customers and you're done. Or if your average customer pays you $10,000, then you  need to find 10,000 customers and you're done. Or on the far end, and so  those are your elephants and your deer, on your far end, you have these flies  and they only pay you $10, but you need 10,000,000 of them." And so it  helps to think about it as you're starting to think about your sales motion, "Well,  how much are my customers paying, and therefore how many of them am I going  to need to have and what sort of sales motion is going to be sustainable  for my business?" Because the way you're selling your product today, is you're flying to  people, you're meeting them at conferences, you're doing everything\.
I described this very kind of  high touch high energy sales process, but your customers are only paying you $10 a  year, or $100 a year or $1,000 a year and you're going to have to  repeat that 10 million times\.
It's impossible\.
It's impossible and it's way too expensive for  you to build your business that way. On the other hand, if you are successful  in building a low touch sales model where you're able to do things, scalably, maybe  you're selling to small businesses, of which there's millions, maybe you have some way that  people doing self service and sign up, well, then you can be over on the  right side of this graph\.
And you can have a lower price product. But the  price of your product and your sales motion are inextricably connected\.
And that's something that  took me a little while to understand, but I thought this graph really helps make  clear, is depending on how much are you able to charge for your product, and  depending on how much people are willing to pay for your product, that'll change how  you approach sales as you're building your company and building your sales team. So those  are some lessons I've learned along the way doing sales\.
I wanted to end and  just say good luck out there. You guys are figuring this out\.
It's the most  fun time of your company, you get to have these really energizing conversations with tons  of users and figure out if they're potential buyers and good luck, because you'll always  look back on this as one of the most fun parts of your journey. So  thanks for having me\.
And I think we have some time for Q&A. Yeah, why  don't we start here.
Speaker 3: Yeah, thank you very much for the talk. Quick question you mentioned about follow ups  and so forth. What would be the appropriate time between emails and just so you  don't seem overbearing and how long do you think it would take for a typical  follow up?
Tyler Bosmeny: I'd say on average maybe a little under a week. So if you email someone,  they don't get back to you, I think it's polite and not over eager to  nudge five, six, seven days later. Yeah. Over here.
Speaker 4: Hi. My name is [Shreys] , I'm the co-founder of [inaudible] \.
And I always  had this sales thing at one point throughout your process did you feel like you  were pestering the customers? Because you can't ... You put it a nice way, "Oh  you got to keep on going. You got to keep on asking, you got to  keep on sending them." Along the process, did you ever feel like you were pestering  your customers or not?
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, so the question was, do you ever feel like you're pestering your customers when  you send them follow up emails? I like to think that if they haven't told,  then you're within your rights to follow up, a reasonable number of times\.
If you're  talking about emailing someone eight times and they haven't gotten back to you, I mean  take a hint, right? But I think if they haven't told you know and especially  if you had an earlier conversation where they were interested, assume the best, assume they're  busy, assume that they've got other things going on. You might not be their top  priority. But there's nothing wrong, especially if you're doing it on a weekly cadence or  something like that\.
And your emails are thoughtful and personalized\.
I have never once in  my life been annoyed by somebody sending respectful follow ups, as long as they seem  thoughtful and personalized. Don't forget that part\.
If it's just like I'm getting mail merged  every week with another template\.
I mean, nobody likes that person. Yeah, over here.
Speaker 5: Hey Tyler\.
Any thoughts on early on when you're trying to get [inaudible] ?
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, I would say you don't learn about product market fit from ... Oh, sorry.  The question was, when you're getting these nose in early sales conversations, how do you  know it when they're just not an early adopter and how do you know when  you should be reading signs of product market fit or lack thereof? And my answer  to that is, I don't think you discover product market fit from the nos, I  think you only discover it from the yeses. So I think when you get nos,  there's a lot of reasons people could be giving you nos\.
And I wouldn't even  necessarily believe the reasons that people give nos. Because in the same way that you  can't trust when VCs give you no, the reasons is, there's just ... People have  struggled to be upfront and honest, and everybody wants to be polite. Where you get  to product market fit, and when you know have something is when you start hearing  yeses\.
And so you just have to try, and if you can't get any yeses,  well there's your signal that you don't have product market fit\.
And if you can  get yeses, there's your signal that you do have product market fit\.
And I think  that's all that matters. Yeah. Here.
Speaker 6: Hi, So while early on and you're prospecting for your first clients, you need to  get your first signed agreement for your products. What is the importance of reference customers  in terms of, would you prefer going after big brands, big names, even if they  require far more work than going for companies that are [inaudible] we can close a  deal [inaudible] ?
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah, that's a great question\.
It is how should you prioritize big companies, which would  be amazing names and logos, if you had them as reference customers or small companies,  which might be faster\.
I think about the advice YC gives for investors, which is  to do a breadth-first search, meaning optimized for speed and optimize for, I would say  talk to all those companies, talk to the big company, talk to the small company,  but then you'll know which ones can can move quickly and not\.
And optimize for  speed\.
A customer is better than then no customer\.
And the big companies are never  the great references, you imagine necessarily\.
I would go for who needs your product the  most and who will move quickly\.
And the reference stuff and the logo stuff, I  don't think you have to worry about that in the early days. You're just looking  for validation and customers. Yeah. Over here.
Maryanne: Hi, Maryanne, [inaudible] \.
I'd like to hear about your pricing journey. We are interested  customers but we're beginning to now get nervous about the pricing. So, wanted to hear  about your journey, [inaudible] did at sales at the UCLA [inaudible] .
Tyler Bosmeny: Oh, nice. Oh, great to meet you. So your question was about the pricing journey.  Yeah\.
And how to set pricing? That is a hard question, because it's so specific  to every company\.
I'll tell you what we did at Clever. We guessed and you  get feedback\.
It's actually kind of neat. You get feedback from the market pretty quickly  and in the early days, you can iterate. Patrick McKenzie likes to talk about how  most startup founders need to charge more, and will usually guess too low. So maybe  one strategy for guessing would be to guess a number that seems reasonable to you  and if you can close that sale, try doubling it the next time and if  you can close that sale, try doubling it again\.
It's really hard to know what  customers will pay. But I'll tell you that original deal I mentioned for $100,000 that  we closed very early on. Why was it $100,000 and not half of that or  double that? It was just us doing a little bit of this and guessing. But  we got feedback and iterated from there on the pricing model. So I think you  just got to try things, be bold, whatever you say, you got to believe it,  "This is the right price for our product, there's no other price that would be  fair for this thing." But then quickly, be willing to iterate as you get that  feedback. Yeah, no problem\.
In the back there. Yeah.
Speaker 8: Yeah. What do you suggest for subscription-based businesses like [inaudible] ?
Tyler Bosmeny: I'm not sure I understand the question.
Speaker 8: For the subscription-based startups.
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah.
Speaker 8: [inaudible] \.
Any new customer, if you just rely on the marketing, they don't have  [inaudible] and then rely on marketing or how [inaudible] ?
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah. So the question is, if you're talking about a $50 price point for a  product, early on in a company's journey, how do you bootstrap a sales effort around  that? I mean, if you're talking about a $50 product, even $50 per month, basically  you probably shouldn't do any of these things\.
And you shouldn't set invest in a  marketing function, because you are going to need so many customers and you can't do  it in a high touch way. So, I look at things like demand generation and  email campaigns and self service signup flows and referral codes and things that companies at  that small price point have to do to be scalable, or raise the price of  your product to support true sales, either way. But that's probably how I'd approach it.
Speaker 8: [inaudible] .
Tyler Bosmeny: Yeah.
Speaker 8: So there's nothing on your website, so to get the first customers-
Tyler Bosmeny: Why isn't there anything on your website?
Speaker 8: [inaudible] .
Tyler Bosmeny: There's no product. Oh, other than the product. That's something. Okay. Sometimes founders do this,  he said, "But what if there's not enough case studies on our website for people  to come buy?" A lot of founders think, they know it's never enough. Whatever they  have is never enough to get people to buy\.
If they had one more reference  account, if they had a few more case studies. That's what it would take for  people to buy. Guess what? If you go on the Wayback Machine for clever.com from  2012, we didn't have any case studies, we didn't have any customer testimonials\.
All we  had was a page that described the product and that was enough to get. For  people who had the need, they didn't care about any of that. They were like,  "Oh, finally, someone's build a solution to my problem. Great\.
I will run through walls  to get it." And we didn't, maybe we have some of that stuff five, six  years in, but we certainly didn't have it at the beginning. So, yeah, over here.
Speaker 9: On your way from mathematician to expert salesperson, what's resources did you find the most  useful?
Tyler Bosmeny: Sorry. One more time.
Speaker 9: On your way from mathematician to dope salesperson what resources did you find the most  useful?
Tyler Bosmeny: Oh, what resources? Yeah, the question's what resources have I learned in doing sales? Well,  first there's no substitute for doing it\.
I've read a number of books on sales.  I've watched things online. 95% of what I've learned has just come from trying it  over and over again\.
And actually, it really appeals to the math and statistics side  of me because you kind of get to EB test everything. Yeah, you try something  new in a conversation, "Oh, that didn't really work. Okay, I'm going to try something  again." You just get to iterate over and over and over again\.
And so that  is the number one way to learn sales. There are some books, there's this one  that I love, it's called, How I Picked Myself Up from Failure to Success in  Selling\.
It's from the 1950s and it's written in this hokey, corny way. But it  so beautifully encapsulates the journey of learning sales and some of the hustle and things  that I was describing as part of it earlier. So that's one resource I've recommended  to founders. But really, you just got to try it. Okay, last question. Yes, you  look like you have a question.
Speaker 10: So you told us about how you started [inaudible] your sales, but can you tell  us about your first few hires? Or your [inaudible] sales team, how did you promote  them, [inaudible] ?
Tyler Bosmeny: Sure. Hiring salespeople, first of all, you have no business hiring salespeople until you've done  a lot of sales on your own. Could be good\.
And the reason is not  just because of what I was saying earlier about how you know, good you are,  it's because you won't even know what kind of people to hire until you've done  a lot of sales on your own. You won't know what the core skills are.  Is it traveling a lot? Is it a lot of phone calls? Is it a  lot of like really good emails? You just won't know. Once you have done sales  for a while, the good news is you'll know exactly the kind of people that  you should hire and typically that's how I've done it. So I've done sales by  myself for three, six, nine, 12 months, made it repeatable to a degree\.
And then  there's literature out there about what you want your first sales reps to look like,  and oftentimes a term that's used, Renaissance sales rep\.
And that's kind of differentiating from  the coin-operated sales rep. Coin-operated meaning they need everything, they need every piece of collateral,  every playbook, every script but then they can go out and execute on it just  relentlessly. On the other side of that spectrum you have the Renaissance reps, what you  needed to start up\.
And these are folks who don't need a lot of direction,  don't need a lot of playbook and they just love figuring things out and probably  your earliest trap, even at Clever today were renaissance, but bigger companies will have much  more on the other end of the spectrum\.
And so you want to look for  those renaissance players who really love to learn, oftentimes they'll have some industry expertise, but  maybe not too much. You probably don't need the person as your first salesperson who  has just ... You probably don't want someone ... Don't be too blown away by  50 years of experience. Not that that's bad, but you can probably get away if  you have the hustle and the grit. That's what's most important at this stage, more  than experience and so, yeah, those are the things I look for. So a lot  of energy, a lot of passion, kind of that renaissance sales rep mentality and then  pattern matching to what I've been doing in the sales process if they have those  skills. Great. Thank you. Thanks guys.
